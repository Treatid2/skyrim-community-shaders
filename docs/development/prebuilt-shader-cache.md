# Prebuilt Shader Cache Runbook

> **Upcoming shader-management work:** test distributions now have a separate
> identity such as `CSX 3.19-VR RC218 (2026-09-07)`. That identity is
> deliberately excluded from `Plugin::VERSION_LABEL`, compatibility markers,

This is the authoritative maintainer and AI-agent procedure for building,
updating, validating, and shipping CSX' prebuilt shader cache.
Use `tools/build-shader-cache.py` for cache generation and
`tools/build-fomod-package.py` for release AIO assembly. Do not assemble cache
blobs, metadata, or installer mappings by hand.

## Purpose and scope

The cache distributes compiled DXBC for CSX' engine-managed
pixel, vertex, and compute shader permutations. It is not a GPU-driver cache,
so it is not tied to a particular GPU vendor. It is tied to all of the
following:

-   the SE/AE or VR shader runtime;
-   the explicit global and feature shader ABI contracts;
-   enabled feature states that affect compilation;
-   the shipped shader source and recursive includes;
-   compiler flags and the resolved stage, feature, descriptor, and custom defines;
-   the permutation inventory in the matching validation YAML.

The default `shipped` release profile:

-   merges `package/Shaders` and feature `Shaders` trees;
-   excludes every `Tests` directory;
-   mirrors the AIO hidden-feature contract for SE and retains the mandatory
    exclusion of legacy `Wetness Effects` sources, metadata and
    `WETNESS_EFFECTS` in both runtimes;
-   enables `UNIFIED_WATER` globally;
-   removes captured global occurrences of file-scoped defines before enabling
    `WETTERNESS` only for `Lighting.hlsl` and `Water.hlsl`;
-   removes obsolete captured `VANILLA_FRESNEL` and `HDR_OUTPUT` defines;
-   omits the VR feature metadata from an SE cache;
-   compiles optimized release bytecode, without developer/debug defines.

`SE` names the shared desktop shader cache for both Special Edition and
Anniversary Edition. AE uses the SE permutation inventory and cache slot; VR
uses its own inventory and `VR` compile state. Shared HLSL/include changes
require rebuilding both caches; desktop-only shader changes require rebuilding
the SE/AE cache. The compatibility and recovery rules below apply to all three
game runtimes.

Every shipped SE/AE and VR build compiles standard and Horizon Fix inputs, then
places both compatible Water variants in one managed `ShaderCache`. Runtime
registration selects the exact Water record; the installer no longer asks the
user to choose a Horizon cache. The builder requires the loose inputs to have
identical permutation inventories and rejects bytecode differences outside
Water before packing them. Named profiles compile one input variant into the
same managed layout.

Named tester profiles are opt-in. Omitting `--profile` always selects
`shipped`; release workflows and existing maintainer commands therefore keep
their current behavior.

The builder removes the five debug-profile defines itself. Do not replace that
filter with hlslkit's `--strip-debug-defines`: the pinned implementation also
injects `D3DCOMPILE_AVOID_FLOW_CONTROL`, which does not match the default
runtime compile state.

Generated inventories may include `captured_shader_variants`, written by
`.github/configs/generate-shader-configs.ps1`. The builder verifies that exact
number of entries before compiling so a truncated capture cannot be packaged.
Both bundled profiles apply `PBR_GRASS=1` and the empty
`GRASS_OPTIMIZATIONS` macro to RunGrass vertex and pixel stages only. Macro
values must match the native factory: empty `PBR_GRASS` is a different cache
identity from `PBR_GRASS=1`, even when both enable the same conditional code.
The SE release build then adds the small, reviewed
`CROSS_MODLIST_SHADER_VARIANTS` overlay. It contains known SE-only RunGrass
permutations which a single clean modlist may not exercise; it is never applied
to VR or named profiles.

The compiler-identity tests also compare generated SE macro tasks with
preserved runtime requests and verify that non-shipped conditional includes
cannot enter the source hash. Pack integrity and matching top-level metadata
alone do not prove that the runtime can reuse individual records. See the
[3.19.2 cache investigation](shader-cache-se-3192-20260926.md) for the failure
and exact identity evidence behind these checks. Trace/debug logging selects
the separate developer cache, so release-cache reuse must be tested at Info
level or above.

This cache does **not** cover feature-specific shaders compiled through
independent `Util::CompileShader` or direct `D3DCompile*` paths. Those can
still compile on first use. A new shader path may be added only after it has a
deterministic cache key and a complete, declared permutation inventory.

For grass, this separate path covers `GrassCullingCS`, its DevBench
`GRASS_DIAGNOSTICS=1` variant, `GrassDepthCS`, and
`GrassInstanceSignatureVS`. Scene Hi-Z uses `BuildDepthCS`, `ReduceDepthCS`,
and `TestBoundsCS`; DevBench additionally compiles its clipping/refinement
A/B, polygon-baseline and diagnostic variants. Production excludes these
DevBench variants. Setup warms these shaders in memory; the managed cache
builder cannot package or reload them. Keep their HLSL and includes in the
AIO and validate them through `GrassBatchShader` and the Hi-Z shader suite.
The existing standalone upscaling and foveated validation inventories likewise
prove compilation, not inclusion in the managed cache pack.

Do not promise users that every possible HLSL compilation is eliminated.
The supported claim is that matching engine-managed permutations can load from
the supplied cache.

The source-closure algorithm exists in C++ and in pinned hlslkit. The
repository's `shader_cache_manifest.py` adds the resolved compiler macros and
writes schema 2 manifests; hlslkit's schema 1 writer is not used for shipping.
Treat source hashing, macro serialization, and digest composition as one
cross-language contract.

The runtime captures the exact macro array before cache lookup and passes that
same array to `D3DCompileFromFile`. Canonical macro encoding sorts by name,
preserves the order of conflicting values, and removes identical neighbors.
Each name and value is prefixed by its UTF-8 byte length and a colon; empty
and null values both encode as `0:`. Lengths preserve boundaries even when a
value contains spaces, colons, or equals signs. Diagnostic macro text keeps
its readable `NAME[=VALUE] ` format. In-memory keys use the encoded form, and
completion publishes under the key captured before compilation. The pack
compile-state hash combines the global hash with the hash of the encoded macros; its
content contract combines the source closure with that compile-state hash.
Loose-cache compile state additionally includes the external compatibility
requirement hash, as before. Deferred writes preserve these captured digests.

The builder reuses `hlslkit.compile_shaders.parse_shader_configs` on the exact
filtered YAML given to the compiler. Every blob must map to a unique compiler
task after ImageSpace remapping, and every task must have exactly one blob.
Missing outputs, duplicate mappings, or unavailable source digests abort
publication. The manifest replaces its predecessor atomically only after all
entries validate. Updating a descriptor's C++ macro mapping now invalidates
its cached bytecode even when its HLSL and explicit ABI versions are unchanged.

The builder spells captured bare defines explicitly empty in the filtered
YAML. `shader_cache_compile.py` adapts the pinned compiler only within its
own process: it validates those definitions as macro names and passes FXC a
whitespace replacement. FXC otherwise treats `/DNAME` as `NAME=1`, and a
trailing `/DNAME=` can consume the next argument. The whitespace replacement
matches the runtime's empty D3D macro; explicit nonempty values retain the
upstream validation and command path. The adapter retains hlslkit's task
scheduler, diagnostics, failure handling, and subprocess ownership.

Runtime stage and descriptor macros are collected separately from custom
macros, then combined in dynamic storage. Custom definitions cannot overrun
the descriptor buffer. The cache-read toggle uses atomic access across UI
and compiler threads.

Schema 1, missing, damaged, and unverified loose manifests require source
compilation; timestamps cannot establish macro compatibility. Managed packs
retain their storage format and older records, but records with the previous
content fingerprint miss and recompile on demand. Rebuild distributed SE/AE
and VR caches with the matching builder to avoid that first-use compilation.
With `Skip Unchanged Shaders` disabled, disk reads are skipped while successful
compiles still update the cache. In-memory reuse remains available.

## Prerequisites

Build on Windows. The manifest's include-path ordering intentionally depends on
Windows path semantics so it matches the runtime exactly.

Use a normal, non-elevated PowerShell. An Administrator shell is unnecessary
and makes manually created output owned by the Administrators group. The
builder copies validated candidates into publication staging paths beneath the
selected output root so release files inherit that root's normal ACL even if an
operator accidentally launches an elevated build.

Install:

-   Git;
-   64-bit Python 3.12;
-   the Windows 10 or 11 SDK containing `fxc.exe`;
-   CMake on `PATH` when creating `.7z` archives.

The builder finds `fxc.exe` on `PATH` or under the normal Windows SDK
directories. A separate 7-Zip installation is not required; packaging uses
`cmake -E tar --format=7zip`.

Check the tools from PowerShell:

```powershell
git --version
py -3.12 --version
cmake --version
Get-Command fxc.exe -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

The final command can return nothing when `fxc.exe` is installed in a Windows
SDK directory but is not on `PATH`; the builder searches those directories too.

## One-time Python setup

Keep the virtual environment outside the repository so it cannot pollute the
working tree:

```powershell
Set-Location <repo>

$cacheVenv = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "CommunityShaders\shader-cache-venv"
py -3.12 -m venv $cacheVenv
$cachePython = Join-Path $cacheVenv "Scripts\python.exe"

& $cachePython -m pip install --upgrade pip
& $cachePython -m pip install -r tools/shader-cache-requirements.txt
```

Always install from `tools/shader-cache-requirements.txt`. Do not install an
arbitrary latest hlslkit: its `shader_digest` implementation is part of the
runtime compatibility contract.

Refresh the environment after the requirements file changes:

```powershell
& $cachePython -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r tools/shader-cache-requirements.txt
```

## Release preflight

Build release caches from the exact clean commit or tag that supplies the DLL
and shader source. The builder reads the working tree, not only committed
files.

```powershell
Set-Location <repo>

$status = git status --porcelain
if ($status) {
    $status
    throw "Release shader caches must be built from a clean working tree."
}

git rev-parse HEAD
Select-String -Path CMakePresets.json -Pattern "CSX_VERSION"
```

Run the feature-version audit before compiling. Shader or include changes
normally require the owning feature's canonical version to change so existing
user caches invalidate correctly:

```powershell
$auditReport = Join-Path $env:TEMP "community-shaders-feature-version-audit.md"
& $cachePython tools/feature_version_audit.py `
    --output $auditReport `
    --fail-on-actionable
$auditExit = $LASTEXITCODE
Get-Content $auditReport
if ($auditExit -ne 0) {
    throw "Resolve the actionable feature-version audit items before building."
}
```

Review suggested bumps before using `--apply-bumps`; that option edits feature
INI files. After any bump, inspect the diff and rerun the audit.

## Build both release caches

Choose a release label for archive filenames. This is separate from the plugin
versions written to `Info.ini`.

```powershell
$releaseLabel = "v1.7.0"

& $cachePython tools/build-shader-cache.py `
    --runtime both `
    --package `
    --package-label $releaseLabel

if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    throw "Shader-cache build failed."
}
```

This compiles HLSL but does not build the C++ plugin. The builder:

1. assembles the release shader tree in an isolated temporary directory;
2. applies the selected cache profile (`shipped` by default);
3. compiles standard and Horizon Fix inputs for each shipped runtime, and one
   input for named profiles, with pinned hlslkit;
4. remaps runtime ImageSpace directories;
5. writes a temporary `Manifest.json` from source, recursive includes, global
   ABI, and enabled feature ABI contracts;
6. writes `Info.ini` with provenance and explicit feature shader ABI values;
7. validates metadata, every manifest entry, every blob, the `DXBC` signature,
   and the bounded Water-only delta between each runtime's inputs;
8. writes optimized and developer A/B packs, verifies every SHA-256 committed
   record and generation, and removes the loose blobs and temporary manifest;
9. packages each runtime's managed cache into a raw archive with no installer
   metadata or automatic runtime detection;
10. publishes output only after every requested runtime has passed the earlier
    stages.

An existing runtime output is replaced only when it has the expected,
non-link cache layout and a readable `[Cache] PluginVersion` ownership field.
The tool refuses to replace arbitrary directories. When both runtimes are
requested, it validates every runtime and archive destination before replacing
any of them. It also preserves the old runtime directory if publishing its
replacement fails. If both publication and restoration fail, the validated
candidate remains in `.<runtime>.publishing` and the old cache remains in
`.<runtime>.previous/<runtime>`, both beneath the durable output root. Resolve
or recover those paths before rerunning; the builder will not overwrite them.
Staging directories and archive files are acquired exclusively before copying;
a competing invocation cannot overwrite or clean up another invocation's work.
The output root may live under the repository (the default is
`dist/shader-cache`), but it must not be inside any shader source tree that the
staging pass copies.

Expected output:

```text
dist/shader-cache/
|-- SE/
|   |-- ShaderCache/
|   |   |-- Info.ini
|   |   |-- PackManifest.json
|   |   |-- Optimized.A.csxpack
|   |   |-- Optimized.B.csxpack
|   |   |-- Developer.A.csxpack
|   |   `-- Developer.B.csxpack
|-- VR/
|   |-- ShaderCache/
|   |   |-- Info.ini
|   |   |-- PackManifest.json
|   |   |-- Optimized.A.csxpack
|   |   |-- Optimized.B.csxpack
|   |   |-- Developer.A.csxpack
|   |   `-- Developer.B.csxpack
|-- ShaderCache-SE-v1.7.0.7z
`-- ShaderCache-VR-v1.7.0.7z
```

Use a unique release label if old archives must remain alongside new ones.
Reusing a label intentionally replaces an ordinary archive file of that name;
the tool refuses linked paths and non-file destinations.

## Refreshing a permutation inventory

Capture from the exact runtime/profile being shipped. Disable any installed
prebuilt shader cache, clear the runtime disk cache, select Debug or Trace log
level, start the game, and wait until the shader compilation counter reaches
zero before exiting. Preserve the completed `CommunityShaders.log`, then run:

```powershell
.\.github\configs\generate-shader-configs.ps1 `
    -LogFile ".tmp\CommunityShaders-clean-trace.log" `
    -OutputDir ".\.github\configs" `
    -OutputName "shader-validation-vr.yaml" `
    -Force
```

Use `shader-validation.yaml` for an SE capture. Always use the wrapper rather
than calling `hlslkit-generate` directly. It normalizes current and legacy
logger prefixes in a temporary copy and requires a zero-remaining queue
record after the last compilation. Missing queue evidence, an active queue
or new compile records after an earlier zero-remaining record are rejected.
It refuses to replace the inventory unless the YAML
entry count equals the clean runtime capture count. The runtime UI can show a
slightly larger total because completed tasks include in-session cache hits;
only source compilation records produce distinct distributable variants.

The completed VR hook-fix capture from 2026-10-05 used source `0d0c8855e`
with local hook fixes and Build ID `866a1d02976c`. It completed 3,635 tasks
with zero failures and contained 3,580 distinct managed source compilations,
including all eight
grass vertex/pixel, depth and alpha-test combinations with `PBR_GRASS=1`
and `GRASS_OPTIMIZATIONS`. Those 3,580 exact release macro identities match
the updated 3,605-entry VR inventory. Retain the 25 additional lighting
entries from earlier captures rather than narrowing coverage to this modlist.
The compact grass regression fixture preserves the producer and log hash;
the full log and comparison remain local. The log confirms native grass
hooks installed, with no draw- or model-hook availability warning. Grass
and scene Hi-Z compute shaders and DevBench variants also compiled through
their separate startup paths. Existing warnings from Effect, Light Limit
Fix, terrain shadows and skylighting remain; none are grass/Hi-Z compile
failures. Hook installation and compilation do not establish visual quality,
batching performance or live LOD coverage.

The captured SE inventory describes one clean runtime profile. Release builds
supplement it with the known SE-only permutations in
`CROSS_MODLIST_SHADER_VARIANTS`, currently RunGrass Pixel descriptors `1` and
`10006` and Vertex descriptors `5` and `7`. Keep this overlay separately
reviewed so regenerating a capture cannot make the release cache specific to
one modlist or import VR-only descriptors.

### Build one runtime

```powershell
& $cachePython tools/build-shader-cache.py `
    --runtime SE `
    --package `
    --package-label "v1.7.0"
```

Use `VR` instead of `SE` for a VR-only cache. Do not distribute an SE cache as
VR or combine the two archives.

### Build the Patka tester profile

`patka` is a persistent, VR-only projection of Patka's provided
`SettingsUser.json` cache contract. When asked to build a shader cache for
Patka, use:

```powershell
& $cachePython tools/build-shader-cache.py `
    --runtime VR `
    --profile patka `
    --package
```

Without `--profile patka`, build the normal `shipped` cache exactly as before.
The default Patka archive label includes both the derived core identity and
`Patka`; `--package-label` can still provide a release-specific label.

The profile is derived from the cache-relevant fields in the tester snapshot
with SHA-256
`7FB038E6F237E1A397282CF7BE3624729E361CE3E1D1D07D2A088B4C06D9063A`.
It records the following features as disabled:

-   Cloud Shadows, CS Editor, Extended Translucency, Grass Collision, Hair
    Specular, Linear Lighting, Performance Overlay, RenderDoc, Screenshot,
    Terrain Blending, Volumetric Shadows, Weather Picker, and Wetterness;
-   Horizon Fix, because the captured tester setup does not have its external
    plugin active. Activating that plugin later intentionally invalidates this
    profile and lets the runtime rebuild compatible entries.

It keeps the optimized VR compile state, an empty custom Shader Defines value,
Partial Precision off, the absent/default-off Avoid Flow Control setting, and
Unified Water enabled. The tester may use either Info or Off logging because
neither enables Developer Mode; use Info for validation evidence. Debug or
Trace changes the compile state and invalidates these optimized blobs.

The stale `ExponentialHeightFog` and `Skin` entries in the supplied Disable at
Boot object are intentionally ignored because neither is a current cache
feature with canonical metadata.

This is not a copy of every numeric rendering preference. Numeric settings that
do not affect feature enablement, shader defines, or compiler flags remain in
the user's settings and do not belong in cache metadata. If the tester changes
any cache-contract field, update the named profile and rebuild it; never edit
`Info.ini` without recompiling the matching bytecode.

### Override `fxc.exe` or worker count

```powershell
& $cachePython tools/build-shader-cache.py `
    --runtime both `
    --package `
    --package-label "v1.7.0" `
    --fxc "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\<sdk-version>\x64\fxc.exe" `
    --jobs 4
```

`--jobs` must be at least 1.

### Override plugin versions

Normally, do not override these values. Official releases ship one
multi-runtime core from the `ALL`/`ALL-VS2022` preset, so the builder derives
both cache version labels from that same preset. A cache's SE/VR permutation
inventory remains runtime-specific, while its `Info.ini` plugin version
identifies the compatible core. Use an override only when deliberately pairing
a cache with an independently built runtime-specific core. In particular, an
SE/AE cache can legitimately carry the shared core's `-VR` version label.
`PackManifest.json.runtime` identifies its cache slot; the display-version
suffix does not.

For one runtime:

```powershell
& $cachePython tools/build-shader-cache.py `
    --runtime SE `
    --plugin-version "CSX 3.15-SE" `
    --package `
    --package-label "v1.7.0"
```

For both runtimes:

```powershell
& $cachePython tools/build-shader-cache.py `
    --runtime both `
    --plugin-version-se "CSX 3.15-SE" `
    --plugin-version-vr "CSX 3.19-VR" `
    --package `
    --package-label "v1.7.0"
```

`--plugin-version` cannot be used with `--runtime both`. Never use the release
tag as the plugin version unless it is literally the plugin's runtime version
label. The label and generated marker are the package handshake; packed-record
validity is independently determined from shader ABI, source, compile state,
and applicable external compatibility requirements.

## Validation and artifact checks

Successful builder completion already proves:

-   both compile inputs of every shipped runtime have the same nonempty permutation
    inventory;
-   only Water blobs differ between each runtime's standard and Horizon Fix
    variants;
-   every requested single-cache named profile contains at least one compiled
    blob;
-   every `.pso`, `.vso`, and `.cso` has a bounded DXBC container with a
    matching declared size, non-overlapping chunks, one shader program,
    consistent program length, and the corresponding pixel, vertex or
    compute stage;
-   the temporary loose-cache manifest uses the supported schema and is removed
    after its content contracts are embedded in pack records;
-   every blob has exactly one valid 32-character lowercase digest;
-   the manifest contains no entry without a blob;
-   `Info.ini` contains the requested plugin version;
-   the archive was created and is nonempty;
-   every archive contains exactly six cache-root files:
    `ShaderCache/Info.ini`, `PackManifest.json`, and all four managed pack files;
-   raw runtime archives contain no `fomod` installer tree;
-   every pack header, SHA-256 record, commit trailer, record count, lane, and
    A/B generation validates using the same binary layout consumed by C++.

Raw archive and FOMOD validation also reconstruct each record's canonical
identity and check the actual permutation coverage of every declared
compatibility variant. Empty packs, declaration-only Horizon support, missing
Water counterparts, and inconsistent record metadata are rejected. Matching
installation-baseline metadata alone does not prove a usable release cache.
Coverage uses records visible under the runtime's active/fallback generation
rules. Every path must retain a shared content contract across variants unless
that source has a declared compatibility define change. Horizon Water records
have distinct macro fingerprints, and at least one Water pair must have
different bytecode. Additional contents may
coexist; each visible optimized record must still match a declared variant's
canonical identity. Record metadata is compared byte for byte, as on an exact
runtime hit.

`tools/shader_bytecode.py` supplies the same structural and stage checks for
loose compiler output and visible optimized archive/FOMOD records. Replaced
records and obsolete generations retain the managed store's existing
visibility rules. Chunk bounds and stage tokens follow Microsoft's
[container declarations](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/include/dxc/DxilContainer/DxilContainer.h)
and [tokenized program format](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/include/dxc/Support/d3d12TokenizedProgramFormat.hpp).
These checks do not validate individual instructions, the DXBC checksum or
GPU execution. Pack SHA-256 validation remains separate. Python tests use
synthetic structural fixtures and do not compile or execute shaders.

Optional operator checks:

```powershell
cmake -E tar tf "dist/shader-cache/ShaderCache-SE-v1.7.0.7z"
cmake -E tar tf "dist/shader-cache/ShaderCache-VR-v1.7.0.7z"

Get-FileHash "dist/shader-cache/ShaderCache-*-v1.7.0.7z" -Algorithm SHA256
```

Inspect the pack metadata and confirm the optimized/developer record counts:

```powershell
foreach ($runtime in @("SE", "VR")) {
    $cacheRoot = Join-Path "dist/shader-cache" "$runtime\ShaderCache"
    Get-Content (Join-Path $cacheRoot "Info.ini")

    $manifest = Get-Content (Join-Path $cacheRoot "PackManifest.json") -Raw |
        ConvertFrom-Json
    $packs = Get-ChildItem $cacheRoot -File -Filter "*.csxpack"
    if ($manifest.schemaVersion -ne 2 -or $packs.Count -ne 4 -or
        $manifest.optimizedRecordCount -le 0) {
        throw "$runtime manifest validation failed."
    }
}
```

Do not “repair” a failed artifact by deleting manifest entries, copying blobs
between runtimes, renaming descriptors, or changing timestamps. Fix the source
contract and rerun the supported builder.

## Install and ship

The standalone SE and VR archives are validated internal workflow artifacts,
available to maintainers for manual installation. Public CSX releases attach
only the complete AIO. Each internal cache archive contains a managed `ShaderCache`
directory. Its optimized pack contains both the standard and Horizon-compatible
Water records; runtime compatibility registration selects the exact record.

For manual installation, copy the matching runtime's `ShaderCache` directory
to `<Skyrim>\Data\ShaderCache`. Never merge the SE/AE and VR caches.

The normal release path bundles the AIO and both runtime caches into one FOMOD.
Its only selection page offers **Skyrim VR**, **Skyrim SE/AE**, or
**No prebuilt shader cache**. It performs no automatic game, DLL, marker,
settings, load-order, or mod-manager detection. The selected runtime maps
exactly one staged source to `Data/ShaderCache`:

```text
ShaderCache-VR/ShaderCache
ShaderCache-SE-AE/ShaderCache
```

Assembly requires each cache pack to identify the runtime slot it is assigned
to and to declare the same shader-cache ABI as the core AIO's
`SKSE/Plugins/CSX.BuildManifest.json`. A disagreement fails the release before
the FOMOD archive can replace the plain AIO.

The plugin validates the managed container's runtime and storage format, then
selects records by shader ABI, feature ABI, source content, resolved macros, compile settings,
and registered compatibility requirements. The pack manifest's seed ABI is
provenance; it does not discard the container merely because the DLL changed.
An exact or overlapping-range-compatible record is reused. Only a missing or
incompatible record is compiled locally and appended, while older versions
remain available until compaction. Enabling or disabling Horizon Fix does not
require reinstalling the cache because both compatible Water records coexist.
Restart the game after changing the companion plugin or CSX feature state so
the frozen compatibility registry reflects it. The Horizon contract applies
only when both the companion DLL and CSX compatibility feature are active.
A partial or corrupt installed layout fails closed to source-only compilation
without producing a legacy loose-cache tree beside the managed files.

Ship the caches, DLL, shaders, compatibility manifest, and feature metadata from
the same ref. Do not package a cache from one commit with the AIO from another.

For a smoke test, use a clean mod-manager profile, move any existing
`ShaderCache` aside so it can be restored, and test the VR, SE/AE, and
no-cache installer paths. Cover SE and AE separately even though they share the
desktop cache. For each runtime, test with the companion DLL absent, present
with the CSX feature enabled, and present with the CSX feature disabled; inspect
`CommunityShaders.log` for pack validation,
compatibility selection, fallback compilation, and unexpected invalidation.

### Generate a VR-only development FOMOD

The assembler includes SE/AE by default. For a VR development or test package,
pass `--no-include-se-ae` and omit `--se-cache`:

```powershell
& $cachePython tools/build-fomod-package.py `
    --core build/ALL/aio `
    --vr-cache dist/shader-cache/VR `
    --no-include-se-ae `
    --output dist/fomod-vr-test `
    --version "VR-test"
```

Use an existing matching AIO Core and managed VR cache, and choose a new output
directory. The command stages `Core`, `ShaderCache-VR`, and `fomod`; the
installer offers **Skyrim VR** and **No prebuilt shader cache**. Both Horizon
Water variants remain required inside the VR cache. It does not build or
require an SE/AE cache and does not change the universal Core DLL.

To generate that cache alone, use `tools/build-shader-cache.py --runtime VR`.
For the normal two-runtime FOMOD, omit the exclusion flag (or pass
`--include-se-ae`) and supply both `--se-cache` and `--vr-cache`.
`--no-include-se-ae` together with `--se-cache` is an argument error.

In a manual **Release: Build Artifacts** workflow run, clear `include-se-ae`
to build and package only the VR cache. This skips the SE/AE compilation job,
archive download, and FOMOD payload. The workflow's existing tag and release
publication rules still apply. Automatic tag/release runs always include
both runtimes; manual runs include both by default.

## CI and release workflow

### Stable main-VR releases

Dispatch `Release: Semantic Version` on `main-VR` with `release_type=stable`
and `expected_version` set to the next CSX patch, for example `3.19.2`
after `csx3.19.1`. The explicit expectation prevents accidentally releasing
a different version. The pipeline requires a clean checkout, the exact
current remote head, a reachable CSX baseline in the universal core's
major/minor line, and an unused next patch tag. It never rewrites tags or
force-pushes a branch. The existing dev/hotfix semantic-release path remains
separate.

The pipeline audits feature versions against the preceding CSX tag, applies
required feature INI bumps unless disabled, and rejects unresolved audit
items. Any metadata commit uses the release bot identity with Rationale and
Implementation sections. It creates the immutable `csx<version>` tag, then
a draft release, and explicitly dispatches the existing artifact workflow.
If artifact dispatch fails after allocation, resume `release-build.yaml`
on that existing tag; do not allocate or replace the tag again.

The shared build passes the validated tag version as `CSX_RELEASE_VERSION`.
For `csx3.19.2`, the DLL/file version is `3.19.2`, its display label is
`CSX 3.19.2-VR`, and the AIO is `CSX_AIO-3.19.2-VR.7z`. The compatibility
label remains `CSX 3.19-VR`, shared by the universal core and both shader
caches. The release version is recorded in producer provenance and cannot
be combined with a test-build identity. Ordinary builds retain their
existing version behavior.

Production explicitly disables DevBench and Tracy. The release build runs
controller tests, shader validation and shader tests, builds both runtime
caches with both Water compatibility variants, validates the FOMOD and
attaches the archives to the draft. Publishing the draft remains a separate
release action. Local allocation/version validation is
`python tests/csx_release_test.py`; packaging coverage remains in
`tests/release_fomod_workflow_test.py`.

`Release: Prebuilt Shader Cache` runs on `windows-2025`, executes the builder
and pinned requirements from the selected target ref, and creates fixed GitHub
artifact names:

-   `ShaderCache-SE`
-   `ShaderCache-VR`

The files inside those artifacts retain the ref/tag label in their filenames.

Run it manually in GitHub Actions, or with GitHub CLI:

```powershell
gh workflow run shader-cache.yaml `
    --ref <branch-containing-the-workflow> `
    -f target_ref=<commit-or-tag> `
    -f runtime=both

$runId = gh run list `
    --workflow shader-cache.yaml `
    --limit 1 `
    --json databaseId `
    --jq ".[0].databaseId"
gh run watch $runId
gh run download $runId -n ShaderCache-SE -D dist/downloaded-cache
gh run download $runId -n ShaderCache-VR -D dist/downloaded-cache
```

For normal releases, `.github/workflows/release-build.yaml` calls the reusable
cache workflow for both runtimes. The release job is gated on cache success,
downloads both artifacts into `dist`, and extracts them beside the plain AIO.
`tools/build-fomod-package.py` validates and stages both managed runtime caches,
writes the one-page manual FOMOD, and replaces the plain AIO archive only after
the replacement is nonempty and contains every required payload. Artifact
attestation and draft-release publication happen after that replacement. The
standalone runtime archives remain internal workflow artifacts. Only the final
`CSX_AIO-*.7z` is attested and attached to the public release; core-only and
individual feature packages also stay internal. See the
[CSX distribution contract](csx-release-distribution.md).
No separate manual cache run is required for that path.

The final AIO archive contains:

```text
Core/
fomod/ModuleConfig.xml
fomod/info.xml
ShaderCache-VR/ShaderCache/
ShaderCache-SE-AE/ShaderCache/
```

## Updating shaders or a feature

1. Change the source.
2. Run `tools/feature_version_audit.py`.
3. Review and make any required version change in the canonical
   `features/<Feature>/Shaders/Features/<ShortName>.ini`.
4. Ensure the SE and VR validation YAMLs still enumerate every intended
   permutation.
5. If a cache profile changed, update its profile constants in
   `tools/build-shader-cache.py`.
6. Build and validate both runtime caches.
7. Smoke-test the exact packaged source, plugin, and cache together.

When adding a feature, explicitly decide:

-   whether it is included in the shipped cache profile;
-   whether it applies to SE, VR, or both;
-   which global/file-specific defines it needs;
-   which canonical feature INI supplies its version;
-   which validation-config entries enumerate its permutations;
-   which cache directories partial invalidation must remove when it changes.

A missing or malformed feature version is a build error. Do not weaken that
check to a warning.

## Updating the plugin version

1. Update the appropriate `CSX_VERSION` values in
   `CMakePresets.json`.
2. Confirm the compiled plugin's `Plugin::VERSION_LABEL` will be identical.
3. Rebuild the caches; do not reuse archives whose `Info.ini` has the previous
   label.
4. Use the release tag only as `--package-label`.
5. Inspect both generated `Info.ini` files before publishing.

## Updating hlslkit or the manifest contract

The hlslkit revision is pinned once in
`tools/shader-cache-requirements.txt`; local setup and CI both consume that
file.

Before changing the pin:

1. Inspect the candidate `hlslkit.shader_digest` implementation.
2. Compare CRLF normalization, XXH3-128 byte layout, ordered hash combine,
   include parsing, root-first include resolution, Windows path sorting,
   cycle handling, global compile-state text, manifest keys, and ImageSpace
   source mapping with `src/Utils/ContentHash.h` and `src/ShaderCache.cpp`.
   Check resolved-task parsing and macro serialization against
   `src/Utils/ShaderDefines.h` and `tools/shader_cache_manifest.py`.
3. Keep `tools/build-shader-cache.py` validation aligned.
4. If compatibility changes, increment the repository manifest schema in
   `tools/shader_cache_manifest.py`, the builder, and
   `src/Utils/ShaderCacheManifest.h`. Update the expected hlslkit source
   schema only when the pinned source-closure contract changes.
5. Update this runbook if prerequisites or commands changed.
6. Perform static checks, then an authorized SE+VR build and runtime smoke
   test.

For a focused compile-input regression check, build the
`shader_compile_identity_test` target in Release, then run with an interpreter
that has `tools/shader-cache-requirements.txt` installed:

```powershell
python -B tests/shader_compile_identity_test.py build/ALL/Release/shader_compile_identity_test.exe
python -B tests/shader_cache_packaging_test.py
python -B tests/shader_cache_pack_builder_test.py build/ALL/Release/shader_cache_pack_test.exe
```

The first command checks macro-only invalidation, the shipped SE/VR inventories,
ImageSpace remapping, stage/value distinctions, legacy-manifest rejection,
C++/Python digest parity, ambiguous-value separation, large macro lists,
atomic manifest failure behavior, complete task coverage, and identical DXBC
from the offline adapter and runtime compiler for empty macros.
These checks do not replace the in-game smoke test.

A digest mismatch is safe because the runtime recompiles, but it makes the
prebuilt cache ineffective. “Safe fallback” is not a successful release
validation.

## Runtime behavior and user expectations

When all six managed members are present, runtime lookup considers every record
with the same logical shader and compatibility domain, newest first. It accepts
the newest record whose source/compile-state contract and external compatibility
requirements overlap the request. Only a lookup miss compiles and appends that
shader. Standard optimized and developer/debug records use separate lanes, so
diagnostic compilation neither evicts nor masks release bytecode.

Each lane has fixed A and B files supplied by the cache mod. Runtime never
creates, renames, copies, or deletes them. Records become visible only after a
validated commit trailer and payload SHA-256; an incomplete tail is ignored and
truncated before the next append. Before the main menu, compaction runs only
when active-generation superseded bytes and fragmentation cross their bounded
thresholds. It writes current logical records into the inactive file at a
higher generation and leaves the old generation searchable as fallback.

Initial runtime admission is non-mutating. Every shipped A/B member must already
contain a valid header; zero-byte placeholders, directories, reparse points in
any path component,
unreadable files, and same-object aliases are rejected without modifying any
peer. On Windows, a writer lease excludes other stores for each physical member,
including overlapping A/B pairs and hard-link aliases. Admission
resolves relative names once, and retains non-delete-sharing parent and final
file handles so admitted paths cannot be rebound or replaced while the lease is
active. The four optimized/developer members must
resolve to four distinct file identities, and any whole-layout rejection
releases all provisional lane ownership. The same release applies when direct
append or reset performs lazy admission and that admission rejects or throws.
Explicit zero-byte bootstrap verifies both truncation and durable flush during
ordinary or exceptional rollback and reports whether the original empty state
was restored or could not be established. Rollback remains armed until the
initialized pair has completed Store admission and index publication.

Schema-2 installation baselines require adjacent A/B generations. Later runtime
compaction or reset may produce a larger actual generation gap. Record sequences
are strictly increasing within each file and valid only from 1 through
`UINT64_MAX-1`; zero and `UINT64_MAX` are reserved.
The Python archive/FOMOD validator and C++ runtime enforce the same rules.

If `PackManifest.json` or any pack file identifies a managed installation but
the six-member layout is incomplete or invalid, CSX compiles from source
without reading, writing, or deleting legacy cache files. `Info.ini` alone does
not identify managed presence because legacy caches use the same filename.
Loose caching, including `Manifest.json`, applies only when no pack-specific
managed member is installed. An explicit clear resets admitted pack files in
place; it preserves partial or invalid managed layouts for installation repair.
Normal source, feature, and external-contract changes never rotate or blanket
delete the managed cache.

A reset barrier becomes authoritative before superseded-file cleanup. If the
empty generation reopens successfully but cleanup fails, the Store remains
available with a degraded-cleanup diagnostic. If the first or final reopen
fails, the Store clears all pre-reset indexes and statistics, releases its
writer ownership, and the runtime quarantines that lane while compiling from
source. Initialization also reports its mutation phase to reset: failure before
opening the target for truncation is non-mutating, while any failure or exception
after that boundary is commit-uncertain (or known durable), invalidates the
pre-reset Store, and releases its path and writer ownership.

Explicit zero-byte bootstrap arms rollback before initializing the first member.
Rollback attempts and verifies both members independently under a nonthrowing
recovery boundary; optional diagnostic construction happens only afterward and
cannot pre-empt physical restoration.

Once reset has reopened its higher empty generation, a cleanup-only failure or
exception retains that generation as available authority and excludes the
uncertain superseded member. Conversely, any compaction failure after inactive-
member mutation withdraws Store authority and releases ownership before return;
the lane then falls back to source compilation rather than exposing stale
fallback locations or statistics.

An exception during append also withdraws Store authority. A clean admission
rescans durable records before any subsequent lookup can use the lane.

Bytecode keeps the source and compile-state digests and optimized/developer
lane captured for that compilation, including across a deferred disk write.
Before accepting any managed-pack or manifested loose-disk hit, runtime
provenance reads the current source-closure bytes; an mtime cache is never
final authority.
Both provenance and the D3D include handler resolve quoted and angle includes
from the shader root first, then from the actual including file's directory.
The compiler checks its source closure again with fresh file reads before
admitting the blob for persistence. A detected change or failed verification
skips disk persistence; a later write never retags an earlier blob with newer
sources.

Users can still compile local variants when:

-   a required exact source, feature, or external compatibility identity is absent;
-   features are enabled/disabled differently from the shipped profile;
-   shader source/includes differ;
-   Developer Mode is active;
-   custom Shader Defines are present;
-   Partial Precision or Avoid Flow Control is enabled;
-   a shader uses an independent feature-specific compilation path;
-   a required prebuilt permutation is absent.

That behavior is intentional. Never force-load a blob whose inputs do not
match.

| Python import error                        | Reinstall `tools/shader-cache-requirements.txt` with the same Python executable used to run the builder                |

| Only some shaders compile                  | Check profile differences, a missing permutation, partial invalidation, and independent feature-specific compile paths |

Keep the prior release artifact until the new one has passed both automatic
validation and runtime smoke testing. If a shipped cache causes regressions,
withdraw that cache artifact; users can safely fall back to local compilation.

## AI-agent operating contract

An AI agent maintaining this system must:

1. Read this runbook and inspect the contract files listed above.
2. Check `git status --short` first and preserve unrelated user changes.
3. Treat “no builds” as prohibiting CMake builds, HLSL compilation, plugin
   compilation, and runtime execution. Do only read-only analysis, source/doc
   edits, and static checks in that case.
4. Run the supported builder only when shader compilation is explicitly
   authorized.
5. Never hand-create, rename, merge, or delete cache blobs to make validation
   pass.
6. Never add a “skip compile” or “force replace/delete” path.
7. Keep the runtime digest, pinned hlslkit digest, builder validation, schema,
   ImageSpace mapping, compile-state string, and workflow in sync.
8. Keep dependency pins in `tools/shader-cache-requirements.txt` rather than
   duplicating them in docs or workflows.
9. Distinguish the plugin version in `Info.ini` from the archive/package label.
10. Use `--profile patka` only when explicitly asked for Patka's cache; omit
    `--profile` for normal release caches.
11. Report the exact scope boundary and any validation not performed.

When builds are forbidden, the minimum static validation is:

```powershell
& $cachePython -c "import ast, pathlib; [ast.parse(pathlib.Path(p).read_text(encoding='utf-8')) for p in ('tools/build-shader-cache.py', 'tools/build-fomod-package.py')]; print('Python AST OK')"
& $cachePython tools/build-shader-cache.py --help
& $cachePython tools/build-fomod-package.py --help

& $cachePython -c "import pathlib, yaml; [yaml.safe_load(pathlib.Path(p).read_text(encoding='utf-8')) for p in ('.github/workflows/shader-cache.yaml', '.github/workflows/release-build.yaml')]; print('Workflow YAML OK')"

git diff --check HEAD
git status --short
```

Also inspect all `D3DWriteBlobToFile` call sites:

```powershell
rg -n "D3DWriteBlobToFile" src
```

There should be one runtime disk-cache save helper. If C++ was changed while
builds were forbidden, state clearly that compile/link validation remains for
an authorized build environment.
