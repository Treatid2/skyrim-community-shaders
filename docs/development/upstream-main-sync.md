# Upstream main review after v1.8.4

Review upstream PRs chronologically against `main-VR`, implementing only
user-approved changes. Exclude E11-only changes, EHF, translations,
upstream-specific UI, and Skyrim 1.7.99 support. Inspect mixed PRs for
independent useful changes. Defer compilation and build-based tests until
the selected ports are complete, as requested by the user.

Skip presenting changes already implemented or better implemented in the
fork, and skip upstream repository housekeeping. Keep postponed work
separate from approved work to implement immediately.

Pinned upstream range: v1.8.4 (`02646c3008dd7cae91fc790c67c0f342a29aa938`)
through main (`5db085e77951b84bd6c191ff5b06d56893f08286`). The review starts
from `main-VR` commit `b6c7b431d79dc213a213d6632c589389eeba555d`.

## #2673: frame-generation allocator synchronization

Approved selective port of upstream commit
`c4b294f1a9cd201a8f4ebc1d3216d573f13b433f` by Shaun Ren.

`main-VR` already advances interop fence values before signaling and
handles counter exhaustion. The missing protection was a CPU completion
wait before reusing a D3D12 command allocator. Track each allocator's last
successful queue signal and wait before resetting that allocator. Retain
the tracking across buffer resizes and clear it on resource teardown.
Record submissions even when presentation returns a retryable result.
Wait failures use the existing proxy quarantine path. The existing VR
frame-generation exclusion is unchanged.

Validation:

-   `pwsh ./tools/git.ps1 diff --check`: passed.
-   `pwsh ./tools/pre-commit.ps1 run --files src/Features/Upscaling/DX12SwapChain.cpp src/Features/Upscaling/DX12SwapChain.h`: passed.
-   `pwsh ./tools/generate-unified-presets.ps1 -Check`: all three tiers verified.
-   Release DLL and focused interop-test build: cancelled on the user's
    instruction to defer compilation. No build or runtime pass is claimed.

## #2674: Skyrim 1.7.99 support

Excluded by explicit user instruction. No part of this PR was ported.

## #2719: shader enablement indexing

Approved selective port of upstream commit
`fef3b94771d3dcb49298f36e21b7e5757c3e381a` by Kuzey Gök.

`State::ShaderEnabled` read `type + 1`, although configuration and UI
storage use `type - 1`. The native ImageSpace compute replacement also
read the Lighting toggle. Reject `None`, `Total` and out-of-range types,
then use the matching class index. Route vertex, pixel and native compute
replacement through that helper on SE, AE and VR.

Retain the native-water exceptions in both graphics hooks, shader-cache
fallback behavior, and VR volumetric dispatch and constant-buffer
restoration. Existing setting keys and array layout are unchanged.

Validation:

-   Source review checked the enum-to-setting mapping, invalid-type guard,
    both native-water exceptions and the unchanged compute dispatch body.
-   `pwsh ./tools/git.ps1 diff --check -- src/State.cpp src/Hooks.cpp docs/development/upstream-main-sync.md`: passed.
-   `pwsh ./tools/pre-commit.ps1 run --files src/State.cpp src/Hooks.cpp docs/development/upstream-main-sync.md`: passed after Markdown table formatting.
-   Compilation, compiled tests and runtime toggle checks remain deferred
    by user instruction. No compiled or runtime pass is claimed.

## #2722: background compilation wakeups and cache probes

Approved partial port of upstream commit
`c321154fa4d0b53e904dd756fd31c29cafc1679b` by 世界的山田.

Background-mode changes now exchange the atomic flag while holding the
dispatcher predicate mutex, then notify the dispatcher after releasing
the lock. Menu settings, the skip-compilation hotkey, the environment
override and the DevBench action use the same setter. Its previous-value
return preserves DevBench's atomic `changed` receipt. The registered tool
description and action schema describe the wakeup behavior.

A loose shader-cache existence probe uses the nonthrowing filesystem
overload. Probe errors are logged at debug level and treated as cache
misses, allowing the existing source-compilation path to run. Source-file
errors still use existing compilation-failure handling.

Retain the fork's content and include dependency validation, managed-pack
selection, in-flight dispatch counter and scope-based slot release. The
SSS keyword and geometry guards already cover the upstream corrections.
These shared changes apply to SE, AE and VR.

Validation:

-   Source review confirmed every background-mode writer uses the setter,
    which exchanges under the wait predicate's mutex and notifies after
    unlocking. DevBench still derives `changed` from the previous mode.
-   Parsed the registered tool descriptor with PowerShell `ConvertFrom-Json`;
    contract major 1 and the existing action list, including
    `backgroundCompile`, remain intact.
-   `pwsh ./tools/git.ps1 diff --check`: passed.
-   `pwsh ./tools/pre-commit.ps1 run --files src/ShaderCache.cpp src/ShaderCache.h src/Menu.cpp docs/development/upstream-main-sync.md`: passed.
-   `ShaderDevBenchBridge.cpp` has unrelated existing formatting drift.
    Restored the whole-file formatter changes and checked only the edited
    lines with cached clang-format 22.1.4:
    `--style=file --lines=237:237 --lines=431:431 --lines=440:440 --dry-run --Werror src/Api/ShaderDevBenchBridge.cpp`.
    This passed. Other applicable hooks passed for that file with only
    `clang-format` skipped. The commit hook uses the same skip after the
    scoped formatting checks above.
-   Compilation, compiled tests, runtime dispatcher wakeup checks and
    filesystem-failure injection remain deferred by user instruction.
    No compiled or runtime pass is claimed.

## #2729: terrain-shadow penumbra stability

Approved adapted port of upstream commit
`44826d2805ae93be0e223708dee1349f3abd4eb5` by Skrubby Skrub In A Shrub,
co-authored by Jiaye.

Propagate upper and lower shadow heights independently with componentwise
maxima. Use signed pixel coordinates for dispatch validity and ray-wrap
checks, sample terrain at the output texel, clamp interpolation taps and
avoid reading prior texture contents during a full refresh. Preserve the
existing signed-modulo helper, unique pixel ownership and scan barriers.

Align receiver samples to heightmap texel centres and soften transitions
by the light's descent over one heightmap step. Return full visibility
outside the heightmap and handle zero-width transitions without division.
Normalize the major pixel direction exactly, handle vertical sunlight
and clamp both penumbra angles before computing world-space descent.

Retain the fork's 1024-unit self-shadow bias, four-degree softening radius,
immediate light-discontinuity refresh, lazy-shader failure handling,
resource naming and profiling. The world-space receiver and its existing
eye-aware callers continue to serve SE, AE and VR. No new settings or
DevBench actions are introduced.

Add matching `ZBlur` and padding fields to the C++ and HLSL terrain data.
Update the fork's feature-buffer size assertion from 32 to 48 bytes and
assert offsets 32 and 36 for the new fields. Subsequent fields retain the
existing size-derived offsets. The shader cache already includes source
and include contents in its identity; no cache deletion is needed.

Validation:

-   Compared compute-shader source against the pinned upstream commit,
    accounting for the unchanged signed-wrap helper, comments and zero
    literals. Compared receiver source with the retained bias and include
    guard: passed. The first strict comparison identified the preserved
    helper difference; explicit comparison with the previous local source
    confirmed that helper remains unchanged.
-   Compared C++ and HLSL field order and scalar widths: matched, totaling
    48 bytes with `ZBlur` at 32 and padding at 36. This is a source check,
    not compiled layout or shader-reflection validation.
-   `pwsh ./tools/git.ps1 diff --check`: passed.
-   Scoped pre-commit checks passed for the six other changed files.
    `SharedData.hlsli` has an unrelated existing comment-alignment
    difference. Restored that formatter change and checked its edited
    lines with clang-format 22.1.4:
    `--style=file --lines=92:93 --dry-run --Werror package/Shaders/Common/SharedData.hlsli`.
    This passed; other applicable hooks passed with only `clang-format`
    skipped for that file. The commit hook uses the same skip after the
    scoped formatting checks.
-   Compilation, compiled tests and runtime checks remain deferred by
    user instruction. Remaining runtime coverage includes both VR eyes,
    map edges, dawn/dusk and vertical sunlight, full refreshes and partial
    final dispatches. No compiled or runtime pass is claimed.

The pinned main queue is fully reviewed through #2729. Grass optimizations
(#2688 and dependent #2706) and the approved PBR-grass port (#2709) remain
postponed. The user extended the review to v1.9.1, as recorded below.

## v1.9.1 hotfix extension

Pinned release: `265c28f53767e94dac1c0c3b211a0aa37d8ec396`, based on the
reviewed v1.9.0 main snapshot. The hotfix contains #2734, #2733, #2730 and
#2747 in that ancestry order. Their equal committer timestamps do not
change that ordering. Umbrella merge #2749 adds no changes over those
four commits; the release commit changes only the upstream version.

#2747 changes only upstream NativeMenu callback ownership and is excluded
under the existing UI rule. #2730 remains to be decided.

## #2734: null textures before vanilla material setup

Approved adapted port of upstream commit
`351118bf51c3af639b9eb144688f048fd4bf7161` by Skrubby Skrub In A Shrub.

The fork centralizes material setup in `src/Hooks.cpp`. Preserve its
initial null-material check and allow custom PBR setup, including neutral
texture fallback, to complete first. Before calling vanilla setup,
require a normal texture and, when no diffuse render target is selected,
a diffuse texture. Materials missing these inputs return before the
engine dereferences them. Valid vanilla materials retain the subsequent
Terrain Helper setup.

This shared vtable hook applies to SE, AE and VR. Existing VR material
admission and render-target checks remain intact. No new settings,
resources or DevBench actions are introduced.

Validation:

-   Source comparison confirmed the guard matches the pinned upstream
    predicate and runs after custom PBR handling, before vanilla and
    Terrain Helper setup.
-   `pwsh ./tools/git.ps1 diff --check`: passed.
-   `pwsh ./tools/pre-commit.ps1 run --files src/Hooks.cpp docs/development/upstream-main-sync.md`: passed.
-   Compilation, compiled tests and runtime checks remain deferred by
    user instruction. Runtime checks must cover missing diffuse/normal
    textures, diffuse render targets, custom PBR fallback and valid
    Terrain Helper materials. No compiled or runtime pass is claimed.

## #2733: orphaned water reflection and normal entries

Approved adapted port of upstream commit
`a9bc5f733d1422bbc14cad3ec7239b7ee4e363a9` by Skrubby Skrub In A Shrub.

Keep the water-system lock across `AddWater`, removal of its temporary
water object and cleanup of newly orphaned reflection and normal entries.
These entries retain raw material pointers that must not remain available
for reuse after their Unified Water tile unloads. Queue array-only entries
through the engine's deferred-release path before erasing them.

Only remove a newly appended, non-null water object with the expected
shape. Find an entry in its owning array before reading its reference
count: the removed water object may have been the sole owner of an entry
absent from that array. Preserve entries with other owners. Retain the
fork's flowmap readiness checks, cache lifetime, reserve behavior,
duplicate cleanup, node ownership and child-worldspace culling.

The shared code serves SE, AE and VR. Keep upstream's SE/AE relocation IDs
69180/70544 and use the verified VR RVA `0xCA7290` through `REL::VariantID`.
No new resources, settings or DevBench actions are introduced.

Validation:

-   Reviewed the ownership sequence, append/shape guards, array membership
    check and continuous lock scope against the pinned upstream source
    and local CommonLib `NiPointer`, `BSTArray` and `BSSpinLock` behavior.
-   Disassembled the preserved live Skyrim VR 1.4.15 image with existing
    Capstone 5.0.7. Snapshot: `20260822T111246Z`, PID 39940, image base
    `0x7FF6F2B30000`, size 60,133,376 bytes, SHA-256
    `1a6fbb7e726491929ea6eaa1dbfd866c48404edaefd63bd712f41fb13ffa2ce8`.
    Local source:
    `build/validation/simple-coc-25x5s-20260925T091018479Z/live-snapshot/live-ghidra-snapshots/20260822T111246Z/SkyrimVR-live-pid-39940-base-00007FF6F2B30000.bin`.
-   Native `RemoveWater` calls RVA `0xCA7290` at `0x4D791C` and
    `0x4D79D2`, passing the address of a temporary `NiPointer` in RCX.
    The callee accepts at most two references; its queue insertion at
    `0xCA7B4A` retains the object. This matches the port's array-plus-local
    ownership before queueing. Reflection/normal array and member offsets
    match the local CommonLib declarations.
-   Native `AddWater` locks the water system at `0x4D6AF3`. The lock at
    `0x143380` increments its recursion count at `0x1433A3` when called
    again by its owning thread, confirming the outer RAII lock is valid.
    The public VR address database at commit
    `87d83ca18ff5ec07ef74cdf8a7920b9172bd6745` independently maps ID 69180
    to the same VR address.
-   `pwsh ./tools/pre-commit.ps1 run --files src/Features/UnifiedWater.cpp docs/development/upstream-main-sync.md`: passed.
-   `pwsh ./tools/git.ps1 diff --check`: passed.
-   Compilation, compiled tests and runtime checks remain deferred by
    user instruction. The snapshot analysis verifies the engine ABI and
    ownership behavior; it does not exercise the patched DLL. Remaining
    runtime checks include repeated terrain-water attach/detach, cell and
    child-worldspace transitions, and vanilla water at matching heights.
