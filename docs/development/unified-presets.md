# GPU-unified presets

The three `CSX Unified` MGO presets use one settings policy on AMD and NVIDIA:

| Tier        | Upscaling quality | SSGI                 | Skylighting | Wetterness | Grass collision |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Performance | Balanced          | Off                  | Off         | Off        | Off             |
| Balanced    | Quality           | Off                  | Low         | On         | On              |
| Quality     | Ultra Quality     | AO-only, provisional | Medium      | On         | On              |

Image Based Lighting (IBL) is disabled in all three tiers through the shared
`Image Based Lighting/EnableIBL=0` policy and generation guard.

Skylighting's `Sample` and `SampleWithShadow` functions always apply
normal-based probe weighting on SE, AE and VR.
The fast-sampling toggle is retired following the inconclusive whole-frame
benefit reported in [Open Shaders PR 706](https://github.com/alandtse/open-shaders/pull/706#issuecomment-5888378723).
Existing default and user settings may retain `EnableFastProbeSampling`;
the loader ignores it regardless of value and preserves all supported
settings. Saving a loaded Skylighting feature replaces its section with the
current schema, omitting the retired key. Settings for features disabled at
boot remain preserved until they are enabled and saved. No manual reset or
settings-contract revision change is required; existing revision-5 unified
presets remain accepted.
Generated presets reject the retired key so new packages cannot reintroduce it.

Exterior and interior Volumetric Lighting share godray intensity, opacity,
saturation, custom colour contribution, and RGB values of `1.0` across all
tiers. Disabling weather-driven Volumetric Lighting during rain is unchecked.

Sky Sync selects the Vanilla sun path with Use Alternate Sun Path disabled
in all three tiers.

Adaptive Balance uses the built-in Fantasy preset for global Bloom shaping,
with the global Bloom strength reduced to `0.50` in every tier.
Its Interior profile enables advanced controls with Emissive `2.0` and
Ambient `0.75` in the shared base for all three tiers.
Its Dungeon profile enables advanced controls with Omnidirectional Bulbs
`1.25` and Ambient `0.75` in all three tiers.
Its Dwelling profile enables advanced controls with Omnidirectional Bulbs
`1.25`, Ambient `0.75`, and Emissive `1.25` in all three tiers.
Exterior Night also enables advanced controls, with Scene Brightness `0.90`,
Directional Light `2.50`, Point Lights and Omnidirectional Bulbs `1.25`,
Ambient `1.0`, and Emissive `1.30`. Its Sky, Clouds, Fog, and Volumetric
Lighting gamma offsets are `0.45`, `0.05`, `0.25`, and `0.30`, respectively.
Its detailed water controls are enabled with Water Brightness `0.70`,
Fresnel Minimum `0.25`, and Global Reflection Amount `1.25`.
Exterior Day enables advanced controls with Directional Light `1.15` and
Volumetric Lighting gamma offset `0.75`.
Its detailed water controls are enabled with Fresnel Minimum `0.25`,
Fresnel Maximum `1.0`, and Muddiness `0.70`.

True PBR uses PBR Metal Reflection `0.75` in all three tiers.

Hair Specular uses Marschner with glossiness `70`, specular multiplier `1.70`,
and diffuse multiplier `0.75`. Indirect specular, indirect diffuse, base
colour, saturation, and transmission are `1.0` in every tier. Tangent shift
and screen-space self shadow are enabled; self-shadow strength, exponent,
and scale remain `1.0`, `0.1`, and `2.5`.

Subsurface Scattering uses Burley with 16 samples and character lighting off
in every tier. Male/female SSS intensity is `1.00`/`1.10`; both use SSS
saturation `1.00`, skin brightness `0.75`, and skin saturation `1.05`.

The capability boundary is the existing pair of upscaling settings. Together
they describe one preference, not a staged DLSS-to-FSR transition:

-   `upscaleMethod=3` requests DLSS when Streamline reports DLSS available;
-   `upscaleMethodNoDLSS=2` selects FSR when DLSS is unavailable.

When the active adapter is known to be non-NVIDIA, CSX resolves the preference
directly to FSR without publishing DLSS as the runtime target. On NVIDIA, CSX
waits for Streamline's capability result before publishing either DLSS or the
fallback. An unknown adapter remains unresolved rather than guessing.

Provider selection reuses the device-owned adapter-description cache and
does not query it when the configured method or completed DLSS capability
already determines the route. Failed adapter queries remain retryable and a
different graphics device requires a fresh identity. Ordinary VR draws with
no pending render-target change return before provider normalization; startup
capability callbacks and pending physical changes still normalize portable
boot profiles before resource application.

Provider-specific tuning remains in the same generated JSON. DLSS reads its
preset and sharpener values; FSR reads its own sharpness and runtime-provider
settings. The graphics-quality policy is otherwise shared.

## Authoritative inputs

Preset generation has three layers:

1. [`Base.SettingsUser.json`](./unified-preset-templates/Base.SettingsUser.json)
   is one pinned, current-schema, vendor-neutral base.
2. [`unified-preset-policy.json`](./unified-preset-policy.json) defines common
   CSX/MGO policy, the complete allowlist of tier-owned paths, all three tier
   values, guards, qualification state, and a fingerprint of the runtime
   settings implementation.
3. [`generate-unified-presets.ps1`](../../tools/generate-unified-presets.ps1)
   composes complete MGO `SettingsUser.json` files and a deterministic evidence
   report.

Every tier must set every `tierOwnedPaths` entry exactly once. Tier overrides
cannot touch operational sections such as Screenshot, Menu, diagnostics,
bindings, or compiler controls. Those values are inherited identically from
the base/common layer. This prevents unnoticed divergence between tiers even
though each MGO package must ultimately contain a complete settings file.

The generator rejects:

-   a base whose SHA-256 does not match the policy;
-   a change to any pinned runtime settings source;
-   a settings-owning feature source that is not present in the pinned runtime
    inventory;
-   a policy path that is absent, differs only by case, or has the wrong JSON
    value kind in the base;
-   any tier count, name, order, or output directory outside the fixed
    Performance/Balanced/Quality contract;
-   missing, duplicate, or extra tier-owned paths;
-   tier writes into forbidden common/operational sections;
-   obsolete Adaptive Balance, screenshot, water, or runtime-derived fields;
-   missing current-schema markers and incorrect profile-array lengths;
-   vendor names in unified output directories;
-   unmanaged extra `CSX Unified` package directories;
-   output settings, metadata, or the generated report that are stale.

The current base includes the main-VR settings migrations for Adaptive
Balance's unified global profile, separate exterior/interior godray profiles,
wet-grass darkening, locked VR menu placement, depth-culling policy modes, and
opt-in verbose PBR diagnostics. Their retired keys are explicitly rejected so
a package cannot silently fall back through legacy migration on first load.

Global and all five Adaptive Balance profiles explicitly include Sky
Saturation, Caustics Strength, Tiling, Speed and Color Dispersion, and Water
Parallax Strength at their neutral value of `1.0`, with Parallax Quality
at `16`. These appearance defaults are shared across tiers and GPU vendors.
Wind-driven waves remain opt-in; their existing settings are explicit in
every profile.

Extended Materials includes the independent mesh and terrain Parallax Strength
at its neutral value of `1.0` in every tier. Legacy settings without the key
also retain neutral depth; this additive default retains contract revision 5.

Ambient Lighting for Effects and Sky Statics is explicitly off in all
three tiers. Its additive default preserves existing settings-contract
revision 5 and weather-based lighting until enabled in Adaptive Balance.

## CSX compatibility contract

All three Unified VR tiers explicitly disable the saved frame-generation
request because VR cannot use frame generation.

The runtime also normalizes frame generation and force-enable to zero
when loading or saving VR settings, including older and custom presets.
Both fields default to zero, and VR exposes no controls to enable them.
SE and AE keep their frame-generation controls and existing behavior.

The generated packages target CSX 3.20.0-VR. Each `SettingsUser.json`
contains a versioned `Preset Compatibility` object with a stable preset ID,
package version, VR runtime, inclusive minimum `3.20`, exclusive maximum
`3.21`, and the settings-contract fingerprint used to generate it.
The generator and runtime loader both use settings-contract revision 5.
The Release compatibility regression loads every generated tier to verify
that the shipping loader accepts its metadata.

The fingerprint hashes UTF-8 source text with CRLF normalized to LF, so
checkout line endings do not change compatibility metadata. It covers
complete inventoried source files, so edits outside
settings methods can also invalidate it. Before refreshing the policy hash,
review serialized keys, defaults, loading, saving and migrations. If those
contracts are unchanged, retain the revision and base, regenerate the
packages, and verify that only compatibility metadata changed in their
settings. Never bypass the source check or refresh its hash automatically.

PBR Grass adds an optional `True PBR.GrassEnabled` setting, defaulting to
false when absent. Existing Unified VR tiers keep their authored settings
and leave PBR Grass disabled. Its shader descriptor flags in `State.h`
refresh the source fingerprint while retaining revision 5 and the base.

Grass Optimizations uses upstream defaults when its optional settings are
absent: the master switch, combining cells, frustum culling, density
reduction and grass Hi-Z are enabled; mesh LOD is disabled. Scene Hi-Z
keeps grass Hi-Z inactive. Existing saved grass choices are preserved.
The added collision distance defaults to 2,048 units and accepts
0–20,480 units. The runtime contract inventories the loader, feature
declaration and policy/default definitions; refreshing its fingerprint
preserves revision 5, the authored base and tier rendering preferences.

Capture settings keep `FrameCaptureEye` authoritative. The base selects
`Left`, so its legacy `Sequence.Outputs.SeparateEyes` mirror is false.
This normalization retains the selected eye and settings schema; rendering
quality and tier choices are unaffected.

CSX validates marked settings before canonicalization, migration, or merge.
Malformed metadata, an unsupported compatibility-contract version, the wrong
runtime, or an unsupported CSX version rejects the complete user
layer without rewriting it. Defaults remain active, saving is blocked to
protect the rejected file, and the decision is recorded in the log and exposed
through the Feature DevBench API's `preset_compatibility` action. Unmarked
legacy and user-authored settings remain accepted because strict metadata
cannot be added retroactively.

CSX 3.20 also accepts the three bundled revision-5 unified presets that
declare the previous `3.19` to `3.20` range. Their settings schema remains
supported, so this version update preserves installed user settings. This
exception does not apply to other preset IDs, other contract revisions,
SE/AE, or CSX 3.21 and later. Product labels include the patch component;
preset compatibility bounds continue to describe major/minor lines.

The three generated presets never hard-disable a feature: every `Disable at
Boot` value is false. Tier exclusions use feature-owned live/soft settings.
CS Editor is not present in the boot-disable map, and Weather Picker remains
enabled because both are operational tools rather than shader tiers.
Wand pointing is likewise a guarded common VR interaction default, so every
tier enables it independently of shader-quality choices.

Generation and `-Check` take one physical-repository publication lock,
independent of command-line paths. Before writing, the generator resolves path
aliases and proves that all outputs are distinct from the policy, base,
generator, focused test, workflow, documentation, refresh source, and complete
runtime-source inventory.

A normal generation records a durable transaction journal before staging,
backs up every existing target, publishes all seven outputs, verifies their
hashes, and only then records the `committed` boundary. The generated report is
the final output and contains the hashes by which a consumer accepts the
generation. A process stopped before that boundary is rolled back on the next
locked run. A process stopped after it is committed finishes cleanup without
rolling back valid outputs. Failed recovery preserves the journal and every
remaining recovery artifact for diagnosis. `-Check` performs recovery first,
then compares expected content without rewriting a valid generation.

## Generate and verify

Generate all three packages and the evidence report:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/generate-unified-presets.ps1
```

Perform the non-writing deterministic check:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/generate-unified-presets.ps1 -Check
```

The generated candidates remain provisional. Qualification state is recorded
in the policy, emitted into each `meta.ini`, and summarized in
[`generated-unified-preset-report.json`](./generated-unified-preset-report.json).
Outstanding evidence includes native NVIDIA selection, a matched SteamVR/OCU
comparison, recalibration after the exact tiled HMD-mask work, AO-only SSGI
ambient/stereo qualification, and an interior volumetric-lighting comparison.
The locked-time OCU exterior screen found no reason to split the shared High
volumetric setting, while confirming Skylighting as the strongest measured
tier lever. Rain and character-focused anchors remain necessary for Wetterness,
Subsurface Scattering, and Hair Specular.

The requested Hair Specular and water-appearance settings are shared appearance
baselines rather than tier levers. Water tint strength is `0.0` in every
tier. The global water baseline includes the 15-unit shore fade, 0.5 wave
amplitude, 0.90 Fresnel maximum, and 1.25 global reflection amount recorded
in the policy.

Shader-cache packing, selective invalidation, and compiler thread/priority
policy are deliberately not graphics-tier settings. Presets keep disk caching
and `Skip Unchanged Shaders` enabled and never request blanket cache clearing.

[`unified-preset-performance-methodology.md`](./unified-preset-performance-methodology.md)
records the controlled timing model, shared deferred-topology cost, and stop
criteria to use when the three tiers are requalified. The compact results are
also available in
[`unified-preset-measurements.json`](./unified-preset-measurements.json). This
evidence does not add a fourth tier or change the current provisional values.
