# Mesh Blending — Implementation Handover

## Status

- The implementation is carried by the current Mesh Blending successor PR on top of current `main-VR`; PR36 remains the historical source branch.
- It contains two independent paths: a depth-gap fade for selected NIF transition shapes and a LAND/LTEX weight remap for material boundaries inside one landscape draw.
- The integrated source has passed the managed CSmain build and complete shader-test target. SE/AE/VR runtime qualification remains pending.
- The design intentionally avoids NIF edits, extra render targets, extra draw passes, and new engine-address hooks.
- Both paths target the normal world `BSLightingShader` path. Reflection, cubemap, shadow, water, effect, and other specialised passes remain outside the feature boundary.

## Current implementation decisions

- Descriptor bit 9 is used because current upstream additive lighting owns bit 8.
- The descriptor is prepared before the original shared Lighting `SetupGeometry` call, matching the per-draw timing used by Extended Translucency and avoiding a possible dirty-state upload inside the original call.
- Static ownership is proven with `TESObjectREFR::Get3D()` plus a bounded ancestry walk. The nearest `BSFadeNode` is not treated as authoritative ownership.
- Model and node rules use an active `ExtraModelSwap` path when present, falling back to the base static model. The selected model and path identities participate in cache validation.
- The shipped default is **Automatic** classification. Allow-list-only remains available for curated deployments, and deny rules always override automatic candidates.
- Allow rules bypass the sibling and bounds heuristic only. They do not bypass source render-state, material, static-owner, animation, pass, or distance safety gates; deny rules always win.
- Renderer submission remains the primary visibility/frustum/portal culling mechanism. A configurable 8192-unit camera/eye-centered bubble rejects distant candidates before owner lookup, cache lookup, string construction, or sibling traversal; zero disables the bubble.
- Classification uses a fixed 4096-entry, four-way set-associative cache with no owning references and a hard 256-object traversal cap. With no effective allow/deny rules, rejected source/material/parent state can hit before owner resolution. Positive automatic entries retain the receiver pointer only as an identity token and, on every reuse, re-resolve the current owner/root, reject animation, compare the full ownership signature, and find then validate that identity through the current bounded root traversal. No cached pointer is dereferenced directly. Configured policy retains the full model/owner signature lookup and 600–855-frame interval. Distance rejects are deliberately not cached. Developer diagnostics separate pre-owner hits, full policy-signature hits, and owner-resolution attempts.
- Automatic receivers are initially required to be fully opaque and non-alpha-tested. This is stricter than the proposal because CPU flags cannot prove that an alpha-test cutoff exactly matches the prepass depth.
- Receiver classification is structural rather than tied to transient application-cull state, keeping cached results coherent when scripted nodes are hidden or revealed. Invalid or absent receiver depth still fails open in the shader.
- VR depth reads explicitly pass the current eye index. Raw depth near either 0 or 1 fails open, covering the far clear value and VR hidden-area/mask values.
- `MaximumGap` is sanitized to at least `DepthBias + BlendWidth`, preventing a discontinuous jump back to full opacity. Clearly negative signed gaps also fail open rather than fading against foreground geometry.
- The MVP continues to reuse slot `t17` and adds no depth copy, render target, draw pass, or geometry. The R16 Terrain Blending depth path should be compared with its existing R32 resource during later runtime quality testing before paying extra bandwidth globally.
- Known-ineligible Lighting permutations are removed at shader compile time. The remaining permutations take one uniform fast-path branch, and only CPU-qualified transition draws sample depth.
- If Light Limit Fix skips the shared Lighting hook for an unsafe directional-light slot, it explicitly clears the Mesh Blending descriptor so stale per-draw state cannot leak.
- The feature is intentionally non-core and its standalone package has `autoupload = false`; publication remains an explicit release decision.
- User sliders and toggles remain in `SettingsUser.json`, while manual policy, detected mesh candidates, and LAND/LTEX material assignments are isolated in the atomically written `Data/SKSE/Plugins/CommunityShaders/MeshBlendingRules.json`.
- The normal feature UI exposes **Record Visible Material Identities**. It records bounded, unique NIF and LTEX identities only as they stream or render; it does not scan installed files and performs no disk I/O until **Save Detected Materials** is pressed.
- LAND material capture occurs after vanilla or True PBR installs the final quadrant properties. A bounded 32-object search registers every eligible multi-texture geometry in each quadrant instead of assuming child zero. Each matching draw records the default LTEX plus five overlays and publishes six 2-bit classes through a bounded registry; unsupported or over-limit layouts remain unblended with rate-limited diagnostics.
- LAND classes occupy `ExtraFeatureDescriptor` bits 10–21. They do not overlap Terrain Helper bits 0–5 and 9 or Extended Translucency bits 6–8.
- The LAND shader remaps the six existing weights before texture sampling. It never activates an authored-inactive layer and therefore adds no texture samples.
- Unknown or reserved material classes fail open. Soft-over-hard favours the soft layer, every already-active soft/soft overlap converges toward equal coverage, and hard/hard keeps the dominant hard layer.

## Executive summary

Implement a Community Shaders feature named **Mesh Blending**. It softens two distinct kinds of terrain seam:

1. the intersection between a transparent NIF transition layer and an opaque surface behind it; and
2. authored LTEX boundaries inside one `LANDSCAPE` draw by remapping its existing six landscape weights.

The principal target is a static NIF containing:

- one or more opaque, depth-writing `BSTriShape` receivers; and
- an overlapping `BSTriShape` transition layer using ordinary alpha blending, Z testing, and no Z writes.

Examples include rock skirts, mountain trim, ground overlays, moss or snow skirts, and similar terrain-like assets. A single NIF or `BSFadeNode` can contain several `BSTriShape` blocks; these are independent renderer draw calls even though artists commonly describe the complete NIF as one mesh.

The MVP should:

1. Inspect a lighting geometry at runtime through an existing CS lighting setup hook.
2. Walk to its owning static root and inspect sibling geometries.
3. Conservatively classify only standard alpha-blended, Z-tested, non-Z-writing lighting shapes with a plausible opaque sibling.
4. Set a per-draw CS descriptor bit for classified transition layers.
5. Sample CS's existing post-Z-prepass depth texture in the lighting pixel shader.
6. Multiply the shape's already-computed alpha by a narrow depth-gap fade.
7. Preserve the original blend, depth, sorting, alpha-test, and material states.

Both paths avoid additional geometry and full-screen passes. The NIF path costs one depth load and a small amount of arithmetic only on accepted source pixels. The LAND path uses bounded arithmetic on accepted landscape pixels and performs no extra texture or depth reads. The NIF path cannot prove that sampled opaque depth belongs to the same asset, while the LAND path cannot invent absent layer overlap or blend a boundary baked into one diffuse texture.

## Problem statement

Terrain-like NIFs frequently combine visually different materials using separate shapes. A common arrangement is:

- an opaque rock or ground body;
- an alpha-blended skirt or overlay around the material boundary; and
- disabled Z writes on the skirt so the opaque surface remains the depth owner.

Conventional alpha blending can still reveal a hard intersection because the authored alpha does not account for the actual view-space distance between the layer and the opaque receiver. The seam becomes especially visible with different albedo, normal, roughness, wetness, or lighting responses.

The desired result is analogous to a soft-particle intersection fade, applied only to carefully selected static lighting geometry.

## Goals

- Require only Community Shaders; do not require an additional SKSE plugin.
- Do not require editing or repackaging NIF files.
- Detect high-confidence transition layers conservatively at runtime.
- Permit CS-side allow and deny overrides keyed to an asset and shape.
- Preserve authored texture alpha and vertex alpha.
- Preserve original renderer state, particularly Z writes, Z testing, sorting, and blend functions.
- Work with placed instances of replaced or modded meshes.
- Avoid full-screen processing and additional geometry passes in the MVP.
- Compose predictably with Extended Translucency and Terrain Blending.
- Blend compatible soft and hard LTEX layers inside the existing LAND shader independently of Terrain Blending.
- Keep classification, discovery, and rendering work bounded from the first implementation.
- Keep a path open for a stricter receiver-ownership implementation later.

## Non-goals for the MVP

- Blending two opaque, depth-writing shapes into one another.
- Blending two transparent or two no-Z-write shapes.
- Reconstructing a hidden second surface from the normal scene depth.
- Resampling the actual material of the opaque receiver.
- Physically blending albedo, normal, roughness, metallic, wetness, or subsurface parameters from two materials.
- Changing geometry, silhouettes, collision, decals, or shadow geometry.
- Automatically processing glass, foliage, hair, skin, particles, water, refraction, decals, effects, or animated geometry.
- Inventing an LTEX layer that is absent from the current LAND quadrant, repairing missing cross-quadrant overlap, or interpreting a material boundary baked inside one diffuse texture.
- Rebuilding LAND geometry, changing `LAND` records, or editing an `LTEX` record on disk.
- Guaranteeing correct object ownership from a single scene-depth sample.

## Important terminology

### NIF root versus renderer mesh

One NIF root can contain several sibling `BSTriShape` blocks. Each shape has its own shader property, material, alpha property, render pass, and renderer state. “Part of the same NIF” is useful CPU-side grouping information, but it has no automatic meaning in a pixel shader.

### Source or transition layer

The alpha-blended, Z-tested, non-Z-writing shape whose opacity CS modifies.

### Receiver

A fully opaque, non-alpha-tested, Z-tested, Z-writing sibling, or the underlying LAND surface already represented in the scene depth. Alpha-tested sibling support is deferred until cutoff/prepass equivalence can be proven.

### Soft intersection fade

A multiplier derived from the linear depth gap between the source fragment and the nearest opaque depth behind it. The source fades out as the gap approaches zero, allowing the receiver to show through at the intersection.

### LAND layer and material class

Each nearby landscape quadrant is one renderer draw with a default LTEX and up to five overlay LTEX layers. The layers are not NIF siblings, so the NIF depth-fade classifier and Terrain Blending cannot operate on their internal boundary. Mesh Blending instead classifies the six LTEX identities on the CPU and remaps only the weights already supplied to that LAND pixel.

The shader transport deliberately uses only four compact states: Unknown, Hard, Soft, and Reserved. The CPU rule model retains more descriptive kinds so policy can distinguish snow, ice, dirt/ash/gravel/mud/sand, grass/ground cover, stone/boulder, wood, glass, metal, and generic soft or hard materials. Exact `LandscapeAssignments` take precedence over the bounded `BGSMaterialType` parent-chain fallback. Unknown and invalid data preserve authored weights.

### LAND/LTEX fast path

The LAND path is independent of Terrain Blending:

1. The existing `TESObjectLAND::SetupMaterial` hook first lets vanilla and True PBR install the final properties.
2. Mesh Blending captures the default and five overlay LTEX pointers for each of four quadrants. A null or zero-form sentinel is resolved like the engine default landscape texture.
3. Exact assignment rules or at most eight material-parent checks classify each active identity.
4. A fixed 4096-entry, four-way registry publishes the six packed 2-bit classes under the final geometry/property/material identity. The single capture writer uses an atomic sequence; render lookup is an exact-match, lock-free probe and fails open on a concurrent update.
5. Each Lighting draw clears the LAND class field. An exact LAND registry hit restores it; all other draws retain zero/Unknown.
6. The pixel shader remaps the current six weights after final EMAT height weighting and before the first landscape texture sample.

At full strength, a soft/hard overlap transfers `softTotal * hardTotal / knownTotal` from hard to soft, so an authored 50/50 pair becomes 75/25. All already-active soft layers receive equal shares of the target soft aggregate, including when a hard receiver is present. A hard/hard overlap retains the dominant hard material. Pair rules can disable otherwise compatible combinations. The result never gives weight to a layer whose authored weight is at or below `0.01`, and it renormalises surviving known weight without reducing the sampled total because of floating-point error.

The active shader path is three unrolled six-layer arithmetic passes with no added texture fetch, depth fetch, geometry, or render target. The uniform disabled path performs no LAND registry lookup and no per-pixel remap. Bounded classification still occurs when LAND streams in so the toggle can be activated live; material recording adds bounded identity bookkeeping only while explicitly enabled and writes to disk only on Save.

## Existing CS facilities to reuse

The implementation should reuse existing mechanisms instead of adding new low-level engine hooks.

### Lighting geometry setup

Relevant existing paths include:

- `src/Hooks.cpp`, `LightingExtensions::BSLightingShader_SetupGeometry`
- `src/Features/ExtendedTranslucency.cpp`, `ExtendedTranslucency::BSLightingShader_SetupGeometry`
- `src/Features/Skylighting.cpp`, which already inspects shader flags, alpha testing, parents, `BSFadeNode`, and BSX data

Use the shared lighting setup chain if practical. Do not add a new relocation merely to classify geometry.

The Mesh Blending descriptor must be cleared for every lighting geometry before optionally being set. A stale per-draw bit would affect unrelated meshes.

### Scene depth

CS already binds a scene-depth SRV to pixel-shader slot `t17`:

- `src/State.cpp`, `State::UpdateSharedData`
- `src/Utils/D3D.cpp`, `Util::GetCurrentSceneDepthSRV`
- `package/Shaders/Common/SharedData.hlsli`, `DepthTexture`, `GetDepth`, and `GetScreenDepth`

The MVP should reuse this resource and the existing screen/depth helpers. Do not introduce another depth copy until compatibility testing demonstrates a need.

### Scenegraph traversal

CommonLib exposes the required data and traversal helpers:

- `RE::NiAVObject::parent`
- `RE::BSVisit::TraverseScenegraphGeometries`
- `RE::NiAlphaProperty::GetAlphaBlending`
- `RE::NiAlphaProperty::GetAlphaTesting`
- `RE::NiAlphaProperty::GetSrcBlendMode`
- `RE::NiAlphaProperty::GetDestBlendMode`
- `RE::BSShaderProperty::flags`
- `RE::NiAVObject::GetUserData`
- `RE::TESModel::GetModel`

### Per-draw permutation data

CS already carries per-draw information through `State::PermutationCB` and `ExtraShaderDescriptor`:

- `src/State.h`
- `package/Shaders/Common/Permutation.hlsli`

Reserve a new matching bit in both C++ and HLSL. Additive lighting already
owns bit 8, so Mesh Blending uses bit 9:

```cpp
MeshBlending = 1u << 9
```

Do not reuse bit 6. RC173 mirrors `IsFemale` at bit 6 in both C++ and HLSL,
and bit 7 is also occupied. Do not overlap Extended Translucency's bits 6–8
in `ExtraFeatureDescriptor`; bit 8 of `ExtraShaderDescriptor` belongs to
Additive lighting, so use bit 9 for Mesh Blending.

## Implemented settings

### GPU settings

The implementation uses a 32-byte, 16-byte-aligned structure:

```cpp
struct alignas(16) PerFrame
{
    float BlendStrength = 1.0f;
    float BlendWidth = 12.0f;
    float DepthBias = 0.25f;
    float MaximumGap = 64.0f;
    std::uint32_t EnableLandscapeBlending = 1u;
    float ProjectedSnowEdgeWidth = 2.0f;
    float Padding0 = 0.0f;
    float Padding1 = 0.0f;
};
```

The numeric defaults are starting values, not validated recommendations. They must be tuned in game. `BlendWidth` and `DepthBias` use the same linear view-depth units returned by `SharedData::GetScreenDepth`. `ProjectedSnowEdgeWidth` scales a derivative-aware edge band on accepted projected-snow meshes; zero retains the vanilla projected-material weight and avoids evaluating derivatives.

### CPU-only settings

Keep variable-size and classifier settings outside the GPU structure:

```cpp
enum class DetectionMode : std::uint32_t
{
    Disabled,
    AllowListOnly,
    StrictAutomatic
};

std::uint32_t DetectionMode = 2; // StrictAutomatic
std::uint32_t RequireOverlappingBounds = 1;
float MaximumDistance = 8192.0f;
float BoundsExpansion = 32.0f;
std::uint32_t DeveloperLogging = 0;
std::uint32_t LandscapeLayerBlending = 1;
```

The UI names mode 2 **Automatic**, and it remains the product default. NIF selection is bounded by static ownership, render-state, animation, material, sibling, bounds, traversal, cache, and distance gates; allow-list-only is available when a curated policy is preferred. `LandscapeLayerBlending` is a separate default-on toggle and does not depend on the NIF detection mode or Terrain Blending.

### CS-side settings and rule format

`Feature::Load` keys ordinary feature settings by display name, and this implementation serializes enum/bool-like values as integers. `SettingsUser.json` contains only the normal feature controls:

```json
{
  "Mesh Blending": {
    "Enabled": 1,
    "BlendStrength": 1.0,
    "DetectionMode": 2,
    "BlendWidth": 12.0,
    "DepthBias": 0.25,
    "MaximumGap": 64.0,
    "ProjectedSnowEdgeWidth": 2.0,
    "LandscapeLayerBlending": 1,
    "MaximumDistance": 8192.0,
    "BoundsExpansion": 32.0,
    "RequireOverlappingBounds": 1,
    "DeveloperLogging": 0
  }
}
```

Asset policy is intentionally isolated in `Data/SKSE/Plugins/CommunityShaders/MeshBlendingRules.json` so recording never rewrites unrelated CS settings. It is loaded once independently of whether a Mesh Blending section exists in `SettingsUser.json`, rather than reread during live settings or performance swaps. Save/Clear perform a bounded best-effort comparison with the exact bytes read for the merge immediately before atomic replacement. A mismatch aborts and preserves captured observations for retry. Windows has no conditional path replacement that can exclude an uncooperative editor after that comparison, so authors must not edit the file while confirming Save/Clear. Schema 4 separates author policy from generated observations:

```json
{
  "SchemaVersion": 4,
  "AllowList": [
    {
      "Model": "meshes/landscape/mountains/mountaintrim01wet.nif",
      "NodePath": "mountaintrim01wet/rockskirt01wet[2]"
    }
  ],
  "DetectedAllowList": [
    {
      "Model": "meshes/landscape/rocks/example.nif",
      "NodePath": "root/snowoverlay[1]"
    }
  ],
  "DenyList": [
    {
      "Model": "meshes/example/glasswindow.nif",
      "NodePath": "windowroot/glass[1]"
    }
  ],
  "LandscapeAssignments": [
    {
      "Kind": "Snow",
      "Form": "0x1234~Example.esp",
      "EditorID": "ExampleSnowLTEX",
      "Diffuse": "textures/landscape/example_snow.dds"
    }
  ],
  "SurfaceMaterials": [
    { "Material": "MaterialSnow", "Kind": "Snow" }
  ],
  "BlendPairs": [
    { "Source": "Snow", "Receiver": "Stone" },
    { "Source": "Grass", "Receiver": "Dirt" }
  ],
  "DiscoveryDiagnostics": [
    {
      "Kind": "Snow",
      "Form": "0x1234~Example.esp",
      "EditorID": "ExampleSnowLTEX",
      "Diffuse": "textures/landscape/example_snow.dds",
      "Material": "MaterialSnow"
    }
  ]
}
```

`AllowList` and `DenyList` are manual policy. `DetectedAllowList` and `DiscoveryDiagnostics` are generated only by the recording workflow. `LandscapeAssignments` override automatic LTEX classification by portable form key, editor ID, or the currently rendered seasonal diffuse path; every entry must provide at least one selector. Leading and trailing ASCII spaces are ignored in those selector fields. `SurfaceMaterials` classify a `BGSMaterialType` identity. If `BlendPairs` is absent, built-in soft/hard compatibility is used; an explicitly empty array disables all automatic LAND pairs. Pair endpoints must be classified materials, and a hard source over a soft receiver is rejected because it contradicts the fixed soft-over-hard hierarchy. Schema 1–3 files are accepted as sparse predecessors and are written as schema 4 only on an explicit Save/Clear. Unknown top-level extension fields survive canonical writes; reserved-array entries are canonicalized to the documented fields.

Save/Clear changes only generated observations and therefore preserves the live LAND registry. If an author edits LAND classification or pair policy while the game is running and then invokes Save/Clear, the changed policy is applied safely, but already loaded LAND entries fail open until their cell/material setup streams again.

Detection modes are `0` disabled, `1` allow-list-only, and `2` automatic. Empty manual `Model` or `NodePath` fields wildcard that component; an entirely empty rule never matches. `*` and `?` wildcards are supported after ASCII lowercase/slash normalization. Generated model/node pairs are always exact. A raw scene name containing `/`, `\`, `#`, `[`, `]`, `*`, or `?`, or equal to `.` or `..`, has no representable node selector. Node-specific rules, including `*`, cannot match that unavailable selector, and discovery cannot save it as an exact pair. Model-only rules retain their meaning. Empty names retain the `#` marker; literal `#` names are unavailable. Percent sequences remain literal; no escape syntax is introduced. Manual plus generated allow entries share a 1024-entry cap; deny rules have an independent 1024-entry cap, and LTEX identities have an independent 4096-entry cap.

An allow match should override automatic rejection only for safe render-state requirements. It must not force unsupported blend functions, disabled Z testing, water/effect shaders, or missing depth resources. A deny match always wins.

### Runtime material-recording workflow

The normal Mesh Blending UI exposes one session-only toggle, **Record Visible Material Identities**:

1. Enable recording and walk through the locations to test.
2. Only rendered Lighting geometry inside `NIF culling distance` and LTEX identities from streamed LAND cells are inspected; the distance slider does not apply to LAND, and there is no directory or installed-NIF scan.
3. A NIF candidate is retained only after the source, static-owner, deny-rule, opaque-sibling, bounds, traversal, UTF-8, and path-safety checks pass. LTEX observations reuse the bounded classification already performed when a LAND quadrant streams.
4. **Save Detected Materials** stops capture, re-reads current author policy, merges exact NIF candidates into `DetectedAllowList`, refreshes LTEX observations in `DiscoveryDiagnostics`, and atomically updates the file. LTEX diagnostics are deduplicated by stable form/editor/diffuse identity rather than their inferred kind; later observations refresh the retained metadata, and a corrected classification refreshes the existing saved observation. One full category does not prevent the other category from saving.
5. **Clear Detected Materials** stops capture and removes only generated `DetectedAllowList`, `DiscoveryDiagnostics`, and current-session observations. Manual allow/deny, landscape assignments, surface rules, pair rules, and unknown top-level extension fields remain intact.

Recording is not an installed-content inventory. It cannot see unvisited, unloaded, culled, or conditional variants. Starting or manually stopping it invalidates the bounded NIF classification cache so stale normal-mode decisions cannot suppress capture or leak back into normal rendering. NIF and LTEX capacities are independent; capture stops only when both are full. No per-identity file writes or log spam occur while walking.

Captured entries are candidates for visual review. The default Automatic mode previews NIF candidates while recording; Allow-list-only mode records without applying unsaved candidates. Saved exact candidates avoid repeating the automatic sibling traversal for that model/node pair, while source render-state, static-owner, pass, animation, distance, and deny gates still apply. Feature-cost A/B measurement cannot start while recording is active, so capture overhead cannot contaminate its baseline.

Malformed, unreadable, oversized, or newer-schema rule files fail closed: runtime blending and discovery are disabled, Save/Clear are locked, and the existing file is never silently replaced. This includes every nonempty malformed manual LAND `Form` and every `LandscapeAssignments[index]` without a semantically nonempty selector. The UI reports the exact entry that must be fixed or removed followed by a restart.

## Runtime asset and shape identity

The allow/deny key must be stable across placed instances and must not depend solely on a raw pointer.

Preferred identity components:

1. Normalised model path from the owning reference's base object when it exposes `TESModel`.
2. Stable child path from the owning NIF root to the geometry, including child indices when names are duplicated.
3. Geometry name as a readable diagnostic field.
4. Optional material or texture signature as a validation field, not the primary key.

Suggested conceptual key:

```text
lowercase(normalised active model path) | root-relative named/indexed node path
```

Do not use only the material hash. Multiple placed cells and unrelated shapes can share materials, and systems such as True PBR can replace materials at runtime.

### Finding the owning asset

Starting from `pass->geometry`:

1. Read the geometry's `TESObjectREFR` user data and require its base form to be exactly `Static`.
2. Obtain that reference's authoritative `Get3D()` root and prove ownership with a bounded parent walk; do not infer ownership from the nearest `BSFadeNode`.
3. Prefer a valid `ExtraModelSwap` model and path when present.
4. Otherwise use the base static's `TESModel::GetModel()` path.
5. Permit an explicit node-only rule to use the root-relative node path when a model path cannot be resolved; automatic detection still fails closed without a stable model path.

Do not attach persistent extra data to the scenegraph in the MVP. Runtime scenegraph mutation introduces cloning, threading, and lifetime questions that are unnecessary for the first implementation.

## Conservative classifier

Classification should have two stages: source eligibility and receiver plausibility.

### Required source conditions

All conditions below should be true unless an item is explicitly listed as optional:

| Check | Requirement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Render pass | Non-null pass and geometry | Safety |
| Shader | `BSLightingShader`/`BSLightingShaderProperty` | Limit the shader implementation |
| World pass | Main world rendering | Avoid menus and specialised passes |
| Reflection | Not an active reflection/cubemap pass | Depth resource and projection may differ |
| Skinning | No skin instance and no `kSkinned` | Exclude actors and animated attachments |
| Alpha | `NiAlphaProperty::GetAlphaBlending()` or an explicitly supported implicit material alpha | The source must already be blendable |
| Source blend | `kSrcAlpha` | MVP supports conventional alpha only |
| Destination blend | `kInvSrcAlpha` | Reject additive, multiplicative, and unusual modes |
| Z test | `kZBufferTest` set | The source must respect opaque depth |
| Z write | `kZBufferWrite` clear | The opaque receiver must remain the depth owner |
| Refraction | No `kRefraction` or `kTempRefraction` | Separate renderer path and feedback risks |
| Decals | No `kDecal` or `kDynamicDecal` | Different depth and ownership semantics |
| Landscape | No `kMultiTextureLandscape` or `kLODLandscape` | LAND layer blending is a separate problem |
| Tree/billboard | No `kTreeAnim`, `kBillboard`, `kLODObjects`, or `kHDLODObjects` | Avoid foliage and distant-object behaviour |
| Character materials | Exclude face, hair, eye, and skin-like paths | Avoid changing actors |
| Root | Static owning root found | Required for sibling analysis |

Also reject effect, water, sky, grass, particle, and other non-lighting shader types before accessing lighting-specific material data.

### Alpha testing

A source that is both alpha tested and alpha blended is possible. Do not support it automatically in the first classifier. Alpha-test ordering can turn a smooth fade into a hard discard or coverage artifact. It can be considered later after explicit tests.

Alpha-tested siblings are rejected in the MVP because the CPU-side flags cannot prove that their visible cutoff matches the depth prepass.

### Receiver plausibility

Traverse geometries only under the selected owning root. A plausible receiver should:

- not be the source geometry;
- use a supported fully opaque, non-alpha-tested lighting path;
- have `kZBufferTest` and `kZBufferWrite` set;
- not use true alpha blending;
- not be refraction, water, effect, decal, particle, or billboard geometry; and
- have a world bound that overlaps, contains, or lies within an expanded tolerance of the source bound.

Bounding-sphere overlap is intentionally coarse. It rejects clearly unrelated siblings but cannot prove per-pixel adjacency. More precise triangle or mesh-distance analysis would cost too much for routine draw setup and still would not establish visible depth ownership.

### Automatic decision

Enable a source automatically only when:

```text
source is safe
AND owning root is static
AND at least one plausible opaque sibling exists
AND source/receiver bounds plausibly overlap
AND asset/shape is not denied
```

An explicit CS allow entry may bypass the sibling/bounds heuristic but should not bypass fundamental renderer-safety checks.

## Cache and lifetime design

Do not traverse an entire NIF for every draw call.

Recommended cache entry:

```cpp
struct ClassificationSignature
{
    const RE::NiNode* root;
    const RE::BSShaderProperty* shaderProperty;
    const RE::NiAlphaProperty* alphaProperty;
    const void* rendererData;
    std::uint64_t relevantShaderFlags;
};

struct ClassificationCacheEntry
{
    ClassificationSignature signature;
    AssetShapeKey key;
    bool safeSource;
    bool hasPlausibleReceiver;
    bool enabledByPolicy;
    std::uint32_t lastSeenFrame;
};
```

Use the current geometry pointer as a lookup key only. Validate the signature from the current live render pass before reusing an entry. Never dereference a cached pointer unless it also arrives through the current pass.

Use a bounded cache with `lastSeenFrame` eviction, similar in principle to other renderer caches already present in the repository. Avoid holding `NiPointer` references indefinitely because that can retain unloaded cells or models.

Classification is expected on the render thread through geometry setup. If later model-load hooks prepopulate the cache from worker threads, guard shared state explicitly and keep render-thread lookups short.

Do not build strings or log on every draw. Compute and retain hashes for normal operation; retain readable strings only for configuration, diagnostics, or a developer candidate list.

## Hook integration

### Recommended flow

Add a function similar to:

```cpp
void MeshBlending::PrepareLightingDraw(RE::BSRenderPass* a_pass);
```

It should:

1. Clear `ExtraShaderDescriptors::MeshBlending` unconditionally.
2. Return unless the feature and shader cache are active.
3. Return unless the pass is a safe main-world lighting pass.
4. Obtain or calculate the classification.
5. Set the descriptor bit only when policy enables that source.

Call it from the shared `LightingExtensions::BSLightingShader_SetupGeometry` chain before the underlying function selects or binds the final shader state. Verify ordering with the existing Extended Translucency, Skin, Linear Lighting, and Light Limit Fix hook chains.

The classifier must not install another independent vtable hook if the shared hook can carry the call. Reducing nested hook ordering is preferable.

### Descriptor definitions

Add matching definitions:

```cpp
// src/State.h
MeshBlending = 1u << 9
```

```hlsl
// package/Shaders/Common/Permutation.hlsli
static const uint MeshBlending = (1u << 9);
```

Clear and set only this bit. Do not rewrite the whole descriptor.

## Shader integration

### Shader helper

The implementation keeps the calculation in a small HLSL helper rather than embedding it directly in `Lighting.hlsl`:

```hlsl
namespace MeshBlending
{
    float ComputeFade(float2 screenUV, float fragmentRawDepth, uint eyeIndex)
    {
        float receiverRawDepth = SharedData::GetDepth(screenUV, eyeIndex);

        // Far clear and the VR hidden-area/mask value retain authored opacity.
        if (receiverRawDepth <= 1.0e-6 || receiverRawDepth >= 1.0 - 1.0e-6)
            return 1.0;

        float receiverDepth = SharedData::GetScreenDepth(receiverRawDepth);
        float fragmentDepth = SharedData::GetScreenDepth(fragmentRawDepth);
        float gap = receiverDepth - fragmentDepth;

        float width = max(SharedData::meshBlendingSettings.BlendWidth, 1.0e-4);
        float start = max(SharedData::meshBlendingSettings.DepthBias, 0.0);
        float maximumGap = max(SharedData::meshBlendingSettings.MaximumGap, start + width);

        // A receiver clearly in front is unrelated foreground; fail open.
        if (!(gap == gap) || gap < -max(start, 1.0e-4) || gap >= maximumGap)
            return 1.0;

        float fade = smoothstep(start, start + width, max(gap, 0.0));
        return lerp(1.0, saturate(fade), saturate(SharedData::meshBlendingSettings.BlendStrength));
    }
}
```

The sign of `gap` must be verified with an in-game debug visualisation before shipping. Do not change it to `abs` to hide a sign error; signed depth distinguishes a receiver behind the source from invalid ordering.

### Placement in `Lighting.hlsl`

The fade must compose with the final authored/material alpha:

1. Let vanilla and CS calculate texture alpha, material alpha, vertex alpha, alpha-test behaviour, and Extended Translucency adjustments first.
2. Calculate `meshBlendFade` only when the per-draw bit is set.
3. Multiply the final output alpha after feature-specific alpha overrides and before alpha is copied into motion-vector or deferred MRT channels.

Conceptually:

```hlsl
float meshBlendFade = 1.0;

#if defined(MESH_BLENDING_AVAILABLE)
[branch] if (MeshBlending::ShouldApply())
{
    meshBlendFade = MeshBlending::ComputeFade(screenUV, input.Position.z, eyeIndex);
}
#endif

// After normal alpha and Terrain Blending alpha selection:
psout.Diffuse.w *= meshBlendFade;
```

The exact placement matters. In the current shader, the deferred Terrain Blending block can replace `psout.Diffuse.w`. Applying the mesh-blending multiplier before that replacement would lose it. Apply the multiplier after any replacement and before the value fans out to `MotionVectors`, `Specular`, `Albedo`, `Reflectance`, `NormalGlossiness`, `Parameters`, `Masks`, and `Masks2`.

For the non-deferred path, ensure the final returned diffuse alpha receives the same multiplier.

### Blend functions

The MVP supports only `SrcAlpha / InvSrcAlpha` source-over blending.

- Do not modify RGB for ordinary non-premultiplied alpha.
- Reject premultiplied alpha initially. If added later, RGB and alpha must be attenuated consistently.
- Reject additive and multiplicative modes initially because reducing output alpha may not reduce their RGB contribution as expected.
- Do not force alpha blending on an opaque shape.
- Do not force Z writes on a no-Z-write shape.

### Depth coordinates

Reuse the existing `screenUV` and `SharedData` helpers in `Lighting.hlsl`. Do not invent independent viewport, dynamic-resolution, or VR eye calculations. The depth SRV and the lighting pass must use matching coordinates.

## Interaction with Terrain Blending

`Util::GetCurrentSceneDepthSRV` returns Terrain Blending's blended depth resource when Terrain Blending is active, and the post-Z-prepass copy otherwise.

This interaction applies only to the NIF transition fade. LAND/LTEX remapping does not call Terrain Blending, sample either depth resource, or depend on Terrain Blending being installed or enabled. Terrain Blending operates between landscape and separately rendered meshes; Mesh Blending's LAND path operates between texture layers inside one LAND draw.

For the MVP:

- reuse the normal `t17` resource;
- verify the target NIF with Terrain Blending both enabled and disabled;
- confirm that the terrain depth offset does not widen or invert the new fade; and
- ensure Terrain Blending's deferred alpha assignment is followed by, not subsequent to, the Mesh Blending multiplier.

If compatibility testing reveals incorrect depth gaps, add an explicit read-only accessor for the unmodified opaque prepass depth rather than duplicating or guessing Terrain Blending state. The desired receiver choice should then become a documented setting or fixed policy:

- ordinary opaque depth only; or
- nearest of opaque and true LAND depth.

Do not sample a resource while it is simultaneously bound for incompatible depth writes. Reuse the existing copied/readable depth path.

## Interaction with Extended Translucency

Extended Translucency already changes alpha for selected lighting materials. Mesh Blending must be a final multiplicative coverage adjustment:

```text
texture/material/vertex alpha
→ Extended Translucency shaping
→ other explicit alpha selection
→ Mesh Blending depth fade
→ output alpha/MRT propagation
```

The new descriptor belongs in `ExtraShaderDescriptor`, not Extended Translucency's `ExtraFeatureDescriptor` material-model field.

## SE and VR considerations

The feature should not require new runtime addresses. Its engine-side work should use the existing cross-runtime lighting setup and CommonLib scenegraph data.

For VR:

- sample the depth for the current eye using existing CS framebuffer/stereo helpers;
- never calculate a custom side-by-side eye offset from assumptions;
- keep the blend band narrow because view-ray depth gaps differ slightly between eyes;
- inspect both eyes for a stereo fringe at grazing angles;
- ensure any debug dither is world-stable and eye-consistent;
- avoid temporal screen-noise dependence when no suitable temporal reconstruction is active; and
- verify MSAA coverage edges, where copied depth may represent incomplete sample coverage.

The VR branch has additional Terrain Blending and depth-override logic. Port the feature by symbol and behaviour, not by blindly copying the SE file layout.

## Reflections, cubemaps, shadows, and specialised passes

Disable the effect outside the main world lighting pass in the MVP.

- A reflection or cubemap pass can have a different depth target and projection.
- Shadow and depth passes use Utility shaders and should preserve the source's existing depth behaviour.
- The source should not suddenly cast or write a depth shape that the original material did not.
- Water, effect, particle, sky, grass, and image-space shaders require separate implementations and should be rejected by classification.

Use existing `InWorld` and reflection state rather than inferring pass type from geometry names.

## Developer diagnostics

Implement diagnostics before enabling broad automatic selection.

Recommended developer-only information:

- candidates inspected;
- candidates accepted automatically;
- allow-list matches;
- deny-list matches;
- rejection reason counts;
- active transition draws per frame;
- cache hits, misses, and evictions; and
- resolved asset/shape keys.

Logs must be rate limited and disabled during normal play. Do not log every draw.

Useful visualisation modes:

1. **Candidate mask:** accepted source shapes in a solid debug colour.
2. **Fade heat map:** black at zero coverage, colour ramp through the blend band, white at full authored coverage.
3. **Depth gap:** signed linear gap mapped around zero, making sign and scale errors obvious.
4. **Receiver-missing mask:** highlight pixels whose depth is clear/far.

Visualisation must be gated by Developer Mode and must not be persisted as a normal user setting.

## Known limitations and expected artifacts

### Depth has no ownership

The copied scene depth contains the nearest opaque surface, not an object or NIF identity. CPU sibling discovery only establishes that a receiver is plausible. It does not prove that each sampled pixel belongs to that sibling.

An unrelated opaque object can influence the fade if it becomes the nearest depth behind the source. The source's normal Z test prevents many invalid cases, but it does not provide group identity.

### View-dependent width

The fade uses view-ray depth separation. A fixed depth width appears wider at grazing angles. Keep the default band narrow and clamp the maximum influenced gap.

### Transparent ordering

The MVP depends on the receiver being opaque/depth-writing and the source being rendered later through its existing transparent path. It does not solve general transparent sorting.

### Both shapes transparent or no-Z-write

Neither shape supplies reliable receiver depth. The MVP must reject this case. Supporting it requires a receiver-only private depth pass.

### Both shapes opaque

The nearest depth discards the hidden layer, and an opaque draw cannot be softly revealed merely by changing a later alpha value. Supporting this requires replay/deferred rendering, an additional depth layer, or an authored material blend.

### Material mismatch remains

Fading final coverage softens a seam but does not create a physical mixture of material properties. Strong differences in normals, roughness, wetness, or directional lighting may still reveal the boundary.

### Silhouettes and geometry

The feature changes opacity only. It does not alter geometry or silhouettes.

### MSAA and stochastic deferred coverage

Depth copies and alpha coverage may differ at partially covered samples. Inspect for halos. If deferred normal/roughness blending uses stochastic coverage, ensure the fade does not introduce VR shimmer. A stable alpha-to-coverage path may be preferable for a later VR-specific refinement.

### LAND overlap is still authored data

The LAND fast path redistributes existing layer weights only. It cannot blend across a quadrant where one side's LTEX is not present, recover a layer discarded by the engine's six-layer limit, or distinguish two materials baked into one texture. Those cases require fixing the LAND/LTEX data in the plugin or source texture.

EMAT parallax coordinates and parallax shadows are calculated before the final Mesh Blending remap. The diffuse, normal, material, and snow samples use remapped weights, but a strong remap can therefore expose a small disagreement with the earlier height-derived coordinates. Moving the remap earlier would change its semantic input and requires separate visual/performance validation.

## Robust receiver-ownership extension

If the MVP produces unacceptable false blends, the next stage can remain entirely inside CS but is more expensive.

### Required resources

- A receiver-only depth texture.
- A receiver group-ID texture, preferably integer.
- A transient group ID assigned to each visible owning root or instance.

### Required rendering

1. Replay eligible opaque siblings into receiver depth and group-ID targets.
2. Preserve their alpha-test cutoff when applicable.
3. Pass the owning group's ID to each transition source.
4. Sample both textures in the source pixel shader.
5. Apply the fade only when the sampled receiver ID matches the source group ID.

This guarantees ownership for visible receiver pixels but adds geometry work, render targets, state transitions, IDs, and lifetime management. It should not be part of the first implementation unless the cheap path proves inadequate.

A single global receiver mask without IDs is insufficient when unrelated eligible NIF instances overlap on screen.

## Material-aware extension

If coverage fading is insufficient, a later material-aware mode could capture or copy the opaque receiver's deferred attributes and blend:

- albedo;
- encoded/decoded normal;
- roughness or glossiness;
- reflectance/specular;
- AO; and
- wetness-related masks.

Normals must be decoded, blended with a suitable normal method, and re-encoded. Directly alpha-blending encoded normals is not correct. Reading and writing the same G-buffer resource is also invalid; copies or a staged pass would be required.

This is substantially more expensive and invasive than the soft-intersection MVP and should be treated as a separate phase.

## Implementation phases

### Phase 0 — Instrumentation

- Add no visual effect.
- Classify and count candidate shapes in Developer Mode.
- Record stable asset/shape keys and rejection reasons.
- Inspect representative mountain, rock, snow, moss, architecture, glass, foliage, and decal assets.

Exit condition: the strict classifier finds intended skirts without accepting obvious glass, foliage, characters, or effects.

### Phase 1 — Feature and policy plumbing

- Add the feature class and registration.
- Add settings serialization and restore defaults.
- Add CS-side allow and deny matching.
- Add bounded classification caching.
- Add developer candidate reporting.
- Reserve matching C++/HLSL descriptor bits.

Exit condition: the per-draw bit is correct and never leaks to the following draw.

### Phase 2 — Shader fade

- Add the HLSL helper.
- Reuse `t17` and existing depth linearisation.
- Integrate after final alpha selection.
- Propagate the result consistently to forward and deferred outputs.
- Add debug mask, gap, and fade visualisations.

Exit condition: the intended skirt fades only near the opaque intersection and preserves authored transparency elsewhere.

### Phase 3 — Compatibility hardening

- Test Terrain Blending enabled and disabled.
- Test Extended Translucency enabled and disabled.
- Test True PBR and standard materials.
- Test multiple placed instances, overlapping instances, and unrelated foreground/background geometry.
- Test interiors, exteriors, weather/wetness, camera distance, and grazing angles.
- Test SE/AE and then adapt to the VR branch using its existing depth path.

Exit condition: no state leaks, no shader-cache mismatch, and no unintended candidates in representative scenes.

### Phase 4 — Optional strict receiver mode

- Add receiver depth and group-ID rendering only if needed.
- Keep the cheap path available.
- Compare quality and cost before choosing defaults.

## Acceptance criteria

### Functional

- Ineligible meshes are bit-identical to the feature-disabled path apart from unavoidable shader permutation selection.
- The feature does not change Z-write, Z-test, blend, alpha-test, sorting, culling, or shadow state.
- An accepted transition layer retains authored alpha away from intersections.
- The transition approaches zero coverage smoothly at the receiver intersection.
- Clear/far depth does not make the source disappear.
- The descriptor is cleared before every unrelated lighting draw.
- Allow and deny rules are deterministic across multiple placed instances.
- Settings save, restore, and live enable/disable correctly.
- A compatible LAND soft/hard boundary favours the soft layer without activating an absent layer.
- A compatible soft/soft boundary approaches equal coverage at full strength for every already-active soft layer.
- Hard/hard, Unknown, reserved, disallowed-pair, and single-active-layer LAND pixels preserve or harden according to policy without adding a texture sample.

### Compatibility

- Terrain Blending on/off does not invert or erase the fade.
- Extended Translucency output remains intact and is multiplied by the new fade.
- True PBR and vanilla lighting materials produce comparable transition placement.
- Vanilla and True PBR LAND materials resolve to the same six LTEX identities after their final properties are installed.
- Reflections and specialised passes remain unchanged in the MVP.
- Alpha-tested receiver candidates are rejected and remain visually unchanged.

### Robustness

- Null pass, geometry, shader property, alpha property, parent, root, user data, or renderer data fails closed. A missing model path can match only an explicit node-only allow rule; Automatic mode fails closed.
- Cache entries validate current live signatures before reuse. With manual rules present, signatures retain the full current canonical model and a versioned length-framed node identity. Every raw name is ASCII case-folded without slash or marker normalization, and each non-root child index is framed separately; empty names, literal markers and delimiter-bearing names stay distinct. The human rule selector is separate from this internal identity. Source or ancestor name, index, and ancestry changes invalidate old policy decisions before reuse; reclassification retains deny-before-allow ordering.
- Cache size remains bounded during cell traversal and fast travel.
- Logging is rate limited.
- No persistent scenegraph ownership is introduced.

### Performance

- No extra full-screen pass in the MVP.
- No extra geometry pass in the MVP.
- Without manual rules, rejected NIF draws avoid traversal after cache warm-up. Rule-dependent lookup resolves current ownership and the bounded ancestor path; unchanged identity retains classification-cache reuse. Positive automatic draws perform a bounded current-root search for the cached receiver identity before validating its live state; a changed receiver triggers normal reclassification.
- One depth read plus minimal ALU only for accepted source pixels.
- The no-rule cache-hit path builds no policy strings. Rule-dependent lookups rederive full canonical model/node strings and can allocate; current policy authorization never relies on a compact hash alone. The added CPU cost has not been measured.
- LAND capture is bounded to four quadrants, six identities, and at most eight material-parent checks per identity.
- LAND draw lookup is a bounded four-way exact probe; active pixels add three unrolled six-layer ALU passes and no texture or depth read.
- Disabling LAND/LTEX blending removes its per-draw registry lookup and per-pixel remap. One-time bounded stream classification remains resident so live activation does not require a cell reload.
- Material recording is deduplicated and bounded; it performs no disk I/O until Save.

Because automatic rules and LAND blending are defaults, use the built-in feature A/B toggle from a fixed camera after warming both bounded registries. Record CPU classifier time, NIF active draws, LAND registry hits, cache hit/miss/eviction counts, traversed objects, and GPU frame time for representative accepted assets and a deliberately dense six-layer LAND view. Label zero-active results as idle-overhead samples rather than visual-effect cost. Repeat the NIF test at 4096, 8192, and unlimited distance in flat-screen and VR. Run LAND comparisons with the same loaded cells and camera because its cost follows accepted on-screen LAND coverage rather than the NIF distance bubble. Material recording must be stopped before measurement. The built-in toggle cannot measure package-install shader/hook overhead because those remain resident in both halves; compare separate loaded/unloaded captures for that question.

### VR-specific

- Each eye samples its own matching depth.
- No stereo fringe at the configured default width in representative scenes.
- No temporal or per-eye dither mismatch.
- MSAA edges do not produce a persistent halo.

## Suggested focused tests

Pure HLSL tests cover fade endpoints, malformed ranges, fail-open gaps, descriptor decoding, LAND remapping, inactive/reserved classes, threshold renormalization, and projected-snow coverage. The complete shader-test target passes on the integrated branch. CPU classifier cases and renderer/runtime scenarios below remain pending; generic shader compilation is not evidence that they behave correctly in game.

### Classifier tests

- Standard alpha, Z-test on, Z-write off, opaque sibling: accept.
- Additive alpha: reject.
- Premultiplied alpha: reject in MVP.
- Alpha-tested receiver: reject in MVP.
- Z-test off: reject.
- Z-write on: reject as source.
- Skinned/tree/decal/refraction/water/effect: reject.
- No opaque sibling in Automatic mode: reject.
- Allow-list entry with safe state: accept.
- Deny-list entry: reject even if automatic rules pass.
- Duplicate geometry names: resolve via root-relative child path.
- Default/zero-form LAND sentinel: classify through the engine default LTEX.
- Exact `LandscapeAssignments` entry: override material-parent fallback.
- Material parent chain: classify within eight parents and fail open beyond the cap or on a cycle.
- Missing `BlendPairs`: use built-in compatibility; explicitly empty `BlendPairs`: reject all automatic pairs.
- Registry collision/concurrent sequence mismatch: fail open rather than returning a neighbouring LAND classification.

### Shader tests

- Depth clear value returns fade 1.
- Gap at/below bias returns fade 0.
- Gap at bias plus width returns fade 1.
- Large gap returns authored alpha.
- Disabled feature or absent descriptor returns authored alpha exactly.
- Deferred alpha propagates consistently across MRTs.
- Soft/hard 50/50 becomes 75/25 at full strength; proportional transfer remains bounded for asymmetric inputs.
- Soft/soft becomes 50/50 for two already-active layers; an authored-inactive layer is never promoted.
- Hard/hard selects the dominant hard layer deterministically.
- Unknown/reserved, packed-zero, one-active-layer, strength-zero, and exact-`0.01` cases preserve authored weights.
- A remapped layer at or below `0.01` is removed, surviving sampled mass is conserved, and no inactive layer becomes active.
- Layer 5/6 class decode uses bits 18–21.
- Projected-snow coverage preserves vanilla behaviour when its edge control is disabled and uses derivative-aware coverage only on an accepted draw when enabled.

### Runtime scenarios

- Target mountain trim at several distances and angles.
- Several instances of the same NIF in view.
- Two eligible NIFs overlapping on screen.
- Actor or unrelated static moving between camera and target.
- Wet and dry material states.
- Terrain Blending, Extended Translucency, True PBR, and upscaling combinations.
- Cell transition, fast travel, save load, and menu open/close.
- Reflection/cubemap scenes to confirm the effect remains disabled there.

## Remaining validation decisions

The implementation fixes the feature name/category, Automatic default, normalized model/node wildcard policy, strict `NiAlphaProperty` source gate, alpha-test exclusion, and initial VR code path. Runtime evidence is still needed to decide:

1. Final blend-width, bias, and maximum-gap defaults after depth visualization.
2. Whether Terrain Blending's R16 depth is adequate or its existing R32 resource is materially better on target assets.
3. Whether bounded acceptance logs are sufficient or an Advanced UI candidate browser is justified.
4. Whether VR should ship simultaneously after stereo/MSAA testing or remain disabled for the first release.

## Recommended first implementation boundary

For the first working version, implement only:

- `BSLightingShader` static source geometry;
- standard `SrcAlpha / InvSrcAlpha` blending;
- Z testing enabled;
- Z writes disabled;
- no source alpha testing;
- a static owning root;
- an overlapping opaque/Z-writing sibling in Automatic mode, or a CS allow-list match;
- main world pass only;
- the existing `t17` scene depth;
- one final alpha multiplier; and
- bounded developer counters and accepted-candidate logging.

Shader mask/gap visualisations remain a deferred diagnostic enhancement. Do not add group-ID rendering, material-buffer blending, opaque-source replay, or support for two transparent layers until the MVP has been evaluated on real assets. This boundary preserves the original reason for the proposal: a cheap, CS-only improvement for authored terrain and rock transition skirts.
