# Upscaling diagnostics boundary

Production upscaling must not depend on retained diagnostic history or on
DevBench being compiled or connected. `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE=OFF` excludes hot-path
reporting; `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE=ON` retains the qualification evidence. A DevBench
AIO still collects that evidence, so this separation is not a performance
claim for diagnostic builds.

| Surface                   | Production                                                          | DevBench build                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presentation observations | Exact eye, cycle, generation, backend and hold-release proof        | Also counts paths and times lifetime/session stretch episodes                            |
| Controller snapshots      | Operational state under its existing mutex                          | Also derives diagnostic owners/phases and stretch reporting                              |
| Transition metrics        | Current request, retry/failure and recovery state                   | Also retains the 50-entry completed/superseded history                                   |
| Stress capture            | No capture state, mutex, event recording or menu controls           | Existing controls, bounded events, schema and health gates                               |
| Memory queries            | System commit and DXGI budget/pressure/admission checks             | Also samples private-process memory and retains its peaks                                |

| Texture lifetime          | No tracking state, sentinels, owner scans or capture implementation | Opt-in bounded lifetime capture and bridge status access                                 |

Useful production debug messages describe transitions and state changes
from information already required by rendering. Optional structured startup
diagnostics require a DevBench build, Developer Mode and their setting.
They do not collect per-frame samples. Diagnostic status messages must not
be promoted to info level. Device loss, allocation failure and other real
failures retain warning/error reporting.

Do not gate the complete presentation observer, memory sampler, current
metrics record, or DLSS dispatch context merely because it contains
diagnostic fields. They also carry authoritative state. In particular:

-   Preserve both-eye coherence, stable-frame requirements, relatch/hold
    release and native presentation decisions.
-   Preserve request/epoch/generation identity, current retry history,
    retirement and post-load recovery, including current-metric clearing.
-   Preserve system-commit reserves, DXGI budgets, pressure hysteresis and
    sampling cadence used by admission and recovery.
-   Preserve the native renderer critical section, accepted-draw tracking,
    frame-token/constants cache, per-eye evaluations and prepared colour input.
-   Preserve all DevBench evidence and schema fields, including diagnostic
    stretch results and rejecting terminal/stereo/active-tail health gates.

Changing compiler guards requires compiling the actual production sources
with the bridge both off and on, including their external callers. A policy
test alone cannot detect a missing guard in a caller or struct declaration.
Run the controller suite, check retained functional symbols and excluded
diagnostic symbols, and scope formatting to the changed files. Runtime
visual and performance qualification remains separate; source inspection
and successful compilation do not establish a frame-time improvement.

## Review and validation, 2026-09-16

Reviewed against parent `f70f29103e282e79d63b216ab2b43ad6bbd8ba33` on
`perf/cpu-dlss-regression-20260916`. The cleanup changes diagnostic collection
and log visibility, not rendering policy. No presets, defaults, shaders,
provider selection, native context ownership or scheduling were changed.

The review followed each gated field to its consumers. Current metrics and
their clearing remain operational; completed history is optional. Both-eye
observations and release decisions remain shared. The two external trace-hook
callers in `Globals.cpp` and `State.cpp` are gated along with the installer;
accepted indexed-draw hooks and menu semantic epochs remain available.
Production retains bounded provider error reporting and debug state changes.
Private-memory figures are omitted from ordinary memory messages rather than
reported as misleading zeros. DevBench JSON retains the real figures.

No alternative controller or duplicated policy implementation was introduced.
Dormant menu-trace helper declarations still share the translation unit with
production menu code; their existence is not evidence of runtime cost. The
production trace-active result is compile-time disabled, diagnostic detours
cannot be installed, and symbol inspection excludes the diagnostic resource
hook while retaining accepted indexed draws.

Validation used CMake 4.4.1 and MSVC 14.51.36231, with Universal SE/AE/VR
Release flags:

-   `pwsh ./tools/cmake.ps1 --build --preset CSmain -- /m:1` passed with
    `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE=ON`.
-   `pwsh ./tools/cmake.ps1 --build build/ALL --config Release --target controller_tests shader_tests -- /m:1`
    built both test groups.
-   `ctest --test-dir build/ALL -C Release -N` saved 124 discovered tests.
-   `ctest --test-dir build/ALL -C Release --output-on-failure --no-tests=error --timeout 300`
    passed all 124 tests in 119.06 seconds, including shader execution.
-   Fourteen actual production translation units, including the API and hook
    callers, compiled separately with DevBench off. This was a compile check,
    not a separately linked production DLL.
-   Three principal translation units also compiled separately with DevBench
    on. All 42 diagnostic/functional symbol-presence assertions passed.
-   A supplementary source comparison found identical C++ tokens in 14 key
    function bodies after selecting DevBench branches, including the complete
    qualification record emitter, frame-token/constants handling, presentation
    observer, promotion and stable publication. This supports the source review;
    it does not substitute for the compiler or runtime tests.
-   Changed-line clang-format checks, other applicable scoped pre-commit hooks,
    and `git diff --check` passed. Whole-file clang-format was replaced by the
    changed-line check to preserve unrelated legacy formatting.

Local commands, compiler logs, symbol assertions, inventory and CTest output
are retained under `build/validation/upscaling-telemetry-audit-20260916/`.
Existing deprecation warnings for Streamline sharpness and Windows string
conversion remain; they were not suppressed. No in-game assay or measured
performance improvement is claimed by this cleanup.

## Submit trace compiler boundary, 2026-09-19

The OpenVR submit trace declaration, implementation and all four external
call sites are compiled only with `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE_ENABLED`. The production
submit path does not depend on link-time elimination of a trace helper
whose tracing-active predicate is constant false. Release enables LTCG;
pre-link references alone do not prove an overhead in the shipped DLL.
This is explicit diagnostic exclusion, not a measured performance fix.

Submit results, packet retention, quarantine and recovery decisions remain
unchanged. Accumulator semantic epochs and accepted-draw processing remain
available in production even where their helper names contain `Trace`.
These helpers carry operational state and cannot be gated as diagnostics.

The targeted object-symbol assertion failed before the correction because
both the definition and the caller reference existed with DevBench off.
Local source, compile logs and symbol checks are preserved under
`build/validation/release-upscaling-audit-20260919/`.

After the correction, both affected translation units compiled with
DevBench off and on, and all 61 selected symbol assertions passed.
Twenty focused current-source controller tests passed, including native
boundary, relatch, stereo and freshness coverage. These are separate
translation-unit checks and a controller subset, not a new full DLL build
or physical-HMD performance result.

## Production build boundary, 2026-10-01

`TRACY_SUPPORT=OFF` now consumes only Tracy's disabled-macro headers, without
linking `Tracy::TracyClient` or inheriting its enable definitions. The PCH
already suppressed `TRACY_ENABLE` in this configuration; generated project
definitions alone were not evidence that profiling hooks reached production.
The dependency boundary now also applies without a PCH.

Texture-lifetime tracking and structured VR pipeline logging are compiled
only with `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE_ENABLED`, including their state and startup caller.
Pipeline diagnostic settings and controls use the same gate. The production
performance menu retains its single-frame OpenVR query; the bulk-history
query is Tracy-only. Rendering, recovery and presentation policy are unchanged.

Validation on MSVC 19.51.36252.0 and CMake 4.4.1:

-   `pwsh ./tools/cmake.ps1 --build build/ALL --config Release --target CommunityShaders --parallel 2 -- /p:CL_MPCount=2 /p:UseMultiToolTask=true /p:EnforceProcessCountAcrossBuilds=true`
    passed with universal SE/AE/VR support and both diagnostic options off.
    The local validation build allowed dirty provenance; it is not a release
    package. Its Build ID is
    `fbb18bc9091ed9d9df833fcc87f1f3ba2799abe27f593c1643d5ea245169fd0a`.
-   The producer manifest matched the DLL's size and SHA-256
    `a751a530d37228e7fc8c15751dcaba8e3124ada3688b4d0b6da48c811e337d9d`.
    The production project has no Tracy client linkage or diagnostic enable
    definitions. Ten selected Tracy/DevBench capture markers are absent from
    the linked DLL.
-   `controller_tests` built, and
    `ctest --test-dir build/ALL -C Release -L ControllerTests --output-on-failure --no-tests=error --parallel 2`
    passed all 163 tests. The Tracy on/off tests compile and link without a
    PCH; the off test also compiles both excluded diagnostic sources.
-   MSVC syntax checks passed for Hooks, State, GpuPass, ProfilingRenderer,
    VR, Upscaling and both diagnostic sources with `TRACY_SUPPORT`,
    `TRACY_ENABLE` and `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE_ENABLED` explicitly enabled. The
    Tracy-enabled non-VR timing-header check also passed.
-   Changed-line clang-format 22.1.4, the applicable scoped pre-commit hooks,
    and diff whitespace checks passed. Whole-file C++/CMake reformatting was
    excluded to preserve unrelated formatting.

A deeper isolated build path failed in the external FidelityFX shader
generator. The same shader succeeded with a shorter output path; the complete
DLL build then passed in the existing build directory. Previous DLL outputs
were backed up. Evidence is under
`build/validation/production-diagnostics-20261001/` and
`build/validation/diagnostic-syntax-20261001/`. No game deployment, in-game
test or performance improvement is claimed.
