# Screenshot API and sequence contract

Status: implementation candidate available in the current worktree; contract
major version 1 is not yet frozen pending null-HMD and physical-HMD
qualification. This document is normative where it uses **must**, **must not**,
**required**, or **terminal**.

Implemented in the candidate are the screenshot coordinator and the shared API
service foundation for envelopes, idempotency, session identity, and journaling;
the DevBench adapter, native service, obsolete-menu compatibility delegation,
in-game control delegation, still and bounded sequence capture,
multi-output/separate-eye processing, partial/final manifests, settings-schema
migration, idempotency, acknowledgement, cancellation, and retention. Offline
preview-video packaging remains capability-reported as unavailable. The test
and live-qualification matrix below remains the gate for freezing version 1.

## Decision summary

CSX will expose screenshot capture as a versioned asynchronous service rather
than a void `RequestCapture()` command. The service covers still images and
scheduled frame sequences. It communicates validation, acceptance, source
selection, fallback, staging, encoder progress, artifacts, partial results,
failures, cancellation, and client acknowledgement.

External adapters are the optional DevBench tool
`communityshaders.screenshot` and the native `csx.screenshot` service published
through the `CSXR` registry. The old `communityshaders.menu` screenshot action
is **obsolete**. It remains temporarily as a compatibility adapter so legacy
clients can migrate, and delegates through that same native service. New
clients must not use it. CSX's in-game capture controls also dispatch through
the native service. Screenshot methods are not appended to the legacy general
`CSAP` vtable.

A sequence is complete when its frame artifacts and final manifest are safely
written. Creating a playable video is an optional post-capture packaging step.
It must never make render-thread capture, frame-set completion, or evidence
preservation depend on real-time video encoding.

## Goals

1. Never silently accept a capture that cannot run.
2. Give every accepted operation a stable server-generated request ID.
3. Make retries idempotent across temporary DevBench reconnects.
4. Snapshot effective options at acceptance so later UI changes cannot alter an
   in-flight operation.
5. Distinguish requested source, resolved source, fallback, view composition,
   encoding, and destination.
6. Report every terminal outcome, including partial sequence completion.
7. Keep render-hook work bounded to source observation and GPU staging.
8. Keep image conversion, encoding, hashing, manifests, and optional video
   packaging off the render and game threads.
9. Bound memory, encoder backlog, event retention, and filesystem use.
10. Preserve still-capture behavior while allowing sequences to reuse the same
    acquisition and artifact pipeline.
11. Make the contract usable from flat Skyrim, Skyrim VR, null HMD, and physical
    HMD runs without implying that all sources exist in every runtime.
12. Make capability and version negotiation explicit enough for unattended
    automation.

## Non-goals for contract version 1

-   Streaming pixels through MCP or the public SKSE messaging interface.
-   Guaranteed capture at an exact wall-clock instant.
-   Blocking a DevBench call until future render frames or disk writes complete.
-   Real-time H.264/H.265/AV1 encoding on the render path.
-   Deleting output files through the API.
-   Exposing D3D resources or STL objects across a plugin ABI.
-   Treating a null-HMD qualification as physical-headset driver timing proof.

## Layered architecture

The feature is split into six internal components with one source of truth for
operation state.

1. **ScreenshotCoordinator** validates commands, allocates IDs, snapshots
   options, serializes source acquisition, applies cancellation, and records
   terminal outcomes.
2. **CaptureSourceProvider** observes an eligible desktop Present or coherent
   accepted OpenVR submissions and stages immutable planes.
3. **ArtifactProcessor** performs readback, orientation, composition, crop,
   resize, colour conversion, encoding, atomic file commit, and hashing on a
   worker thread.
4. **SequenceScheduler** selects eligible game frames or wall-clock windows and
   submits child frame captures without reserving future encoder slots.
5. **RequestJournal** owns bounded request records and monotonically ordered
   events, including terminal receipts and client acknowledgements.
6. **Adapters** translate UI/hotkey, DevBench JSON, and the native CSXR service
   into the same coordinator commands.

No adapter may reach into `ActiveCapture`, the encoder queue, or source hooks
directly. UI and hotkey requests receive IDs and receipts too, even if they only
surface a HUD message to the player.

While a sequence is actively recording, CSX presents one red status dot at eye
height, one eighth of the submitted eye width left of centre. In VR it is
headset-locked (including the OpenComposite per-eye path), and it is composed
only after the lossless source for that frame has been staged. It therefore
remains visible without entering the saved frame set. Stop/finalize messages
may use the ordinary HUD; no second recording overlay is drawn.

The dot requires completed destination preparation and the sequence's owned
directory lease. It remains off while preparation is pending or fails, and
after a stop, cancellation, finalization or the last frame is scheduled.

## Contract identity and versioning

### Tool identity

-   DevBench tool: `communityshaders.screenshot`
-   Contract name: `csx.screenshot`
-   Initial contract: major `1`, minor `0`
-   Schema URN: `urn:csx:devbench:screenshot:1`

### Native discovery

Discover CSXR during or after `PostPostLoad` for ordinary screenshot use.
CSX retains early `PostLoad` discovery and refreshes the listener to include
plugins loaded later; see [API service registry](api-service-registry.md).

Native SKSE consumers request the `CSXR` registry described by
`include/VRAPI/CSserviceapi.h`, then query `csx.screenshot` major 1 with the
inspection, runtime-mutation, asynchronous-operation, and event-stream
capabilities. `include/VRAPI/CSscreenshotapi.h` exposes one ABI-stable
`Dispatch` function over this document's UTF-8 JSON contract.

`Dispatch` validates or admits a request synchronously; calls from Papyrus or
other native threads are marshalled to Skyrim's runtime main thread with a
bounded wait. Capture, encoding, hashing, and sequence finalization remain
asynchronous. The returned JSON bytes are owned by CSX and remain valid until
the caller's next `Dispatch` on the same thread, so clients must copy them.
Transport failures use `CSX::ScreenshotAPI::Status`; command rejection and
operation state remain in the normal JSON response envelope.

Every request must include `contractMajor`.
Clients may include `contractMinor`; absence means zero. A major mismatch is a
structured `unsupported_contract_version` error and must not perform work.

Minor revisions are additive. A server may add fields, events, capabilities,
error details, and enum values advertised by capabilities. It must not change
the meaning or type of an existing version-1 field. A breaking change uses a
new major version and, if necessary, a new tool alias during migration.

`schemaRevision` identifies corrections or additive schema detail within the
same major/minor semantics. It is not a substitute for a breaking major.

### Response envelope

Every response, including errors, uses one envelope:

```json
{
    "ok": true,
    "contract": {
        "name": "csx.screenshot",
        "major": 1,
        "minor": 0,
        "schemaRevision": 1
    },
    "server": {
        "sessionId": "55be1d4e-7d90-4eb9-9199-cbb50fd31388",
        "csxBuild": 11,
        "csxVersion": "3.19-VR",
        "featureVersion": "1.5.1",
        "binary": {
            "sha256": null,
            "sourceRevision": null,
            "identityState": "not_recorded"
        },
        "runtime": {
            "game": "SkyrimVR",
            "presentation": "openvr",
            "hmd": "unknown"
        },
        "devBenchBuilt": true
    },
    "command": {
        "action": "capture",
        "clientId": "automation-host-a",
        "commandId": "0de51a0e-8ed6-49ee-a1ca-94b5aa54a919"
    },
    "timestampUtc": "2026-08-20T04:15:30.1234567Z",
    "result": {}
}
```

`sessionId` changes at each Skyrim/CSX process start. `commandId` is generated
by the client and supplies idempotency. Within one server session, repeating
the same `(clientId, commandId)` tuple returns the original command result or current
operation receipt and must not create a second capture. Reusing the pair with
different arguments is `idempotency_conflict`.

The server-generated `requestId` identifies accepted screenshot or sequence
work. It is distinct from the client command ID because status, stop, cancel,
poll, and acknowledgement commands each have their own command IDs.

`binary.identityState` is `complete`, `partial`, or `not_recorded`. Null identity
fields are explicit unknowns, never permission to infer a commit from a filename
or DLL timestamp. Production and evidence builds should cache the DLL hash and
source revision at startup so receipts can identify exactly what produced an
artifact.

### Error envelope

```json
{
    "ok": false,
    "contract": {
        "name": "csx.screenshot",
        "major": 1,
        "minor": 0,
        "schemaRevision": 1
    },
    "server": {
        "sessionId": "55be1d4e-7d90-4eb9-9199-cbb50fd31388",
        "csxBuild": 11,
        "csxVersion": "3.19-VR",
        "featureVersion": "1.5.1",
        "binary": {
            "sha256": null,
            "sourceRevision": null,
            "identityState": "not_recorded"
        },
        "runtime": {
            "game": "SkyrimVR",
            "presentation": "openvr",
            "hmd": "unknown"
        }
    },
    "command": {
        "action": "capture",
        "clientId": "automation-host-a",
        "commandId": "0de51a0e-8ed6-49ee-a1ca-94b5aa54a919"
    },
    "timestampUtc": "2026-08-20T04:15:30.1234567Z",
    "error": {
        "code": "feature_disabled",
        "message": "CSX screenshot capture is disabled",
        "phase": "validation",
        "retryable": true,
        "field": null,
        "requestId": null,
        "details": {}
    }
}
```

Human-readable text is diagnostic. Automation must branch on `error.code`, not
message text.

## Actions

Version 1 defines these actions:

| Action              | Mutation | Purpose                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capabilities`      | No       | Contract, runtime, sources, views, encoders, limits, and optional components |
| `status`            | No       | Feature, worker, queue, active-operation, and journal summary                |
| `settings_get`      | No       | Current persisted and effective screenshot settings                          |
| `settings_validate` | No       | Validate a proposed settings patch without applying it                       |
| `settings_apply`    | Yes      | Apply an explicit runtime or persisted settings patch                        |
| `capture`           | Yes      | Submit one still operation                                                   |
| `sequence_start`    | Yes      | Submit one scheduled frame sequence                                          |
| `sequence_stop`     | Yes      | Gracefully stop scheduling and finalize frames already accepted              |
| `request_get`       | No       | Return one current or terminal receipt                                       |
| `request_list`      | No       | Return bounded summaries, with filters and pagination                        |
| `request_cancel`    | Yes      | Cancel work that has not crossed an irreversible commit boundary             |
| `events_poll`       | No       | Read journal events after a cursor                                           |
| `acknowledge`       | Yes      | Confirm receipt of events or a terminal operation receipt                    |

`status` must never trigger capture. This differs deliberately from the legacy
profiler status behavior.

### Capabilities

Capabilities are authoritative. UI and clients must not infer support from the
game edition or a previously observed build number.

The response includes at least:

```json
{
    "sources": ["desktop_mirror", "hmd_submission"],
    "views": [
        "source_native",
        "left_eye",
        "right_eye",
        "side_by_side",
        "framed_left",
        "framed_right",
        "framed_combined"
    ],
    "formats": ["png", "bmp"],
    "colourContracts": ["sdr_srgb"],
    "scheduleBases": ["game_frames", "wall_clock"],
    "pathPolicies": ["settings_default", "game_relative", "absolute"],
    "optional": {
        "separateEyeArtifacts": true,
        "clipboardFileReference": true,
        "previewVideo": {
            "available": false,
            "encoders": [],
            "runsAfterFrameFinalization": true
        }
    },
    "limits": {
        "activeSourceCaptures": 1,
        "outstandingCaptureJobs": 2,
        "maximumOutputsPerCaptureJob": 4,
        "pendingOperations": 64,
        "maximumOutputsPerFrame": 4,
        "maximumSequenceFrames": 10000,
        "maximumSequenceDurationMs": 3600000,
        "maximumRetainedTerminalRequests": 256,
        "maximumRetainedEvents": 4096,
        "retentionSeconds": 3600
    }
}
```

These numbers are examples, not frozen limits. The implementation reports its
actual values. The present worker's two-outstanding-capture-job limit may remain
initially; a sequence scheduler must adapt rather than enlarge it blindly.

### Operational status

`status` is a read-only health snapshot. It reports enough information to
distinguish feature configuration, source readiness, active acquisition,
worker backlog, and journal retention without initiating work:

```json
{
    "feature": {
        "loaded": true,
        "enabled": true,
        "settingsSchemaVersion": 2
    },
    "sourceReadiness": {
        "desktopPresentObserved": true,
        "openVrSubmitHookInstalled": true,
        "lastAcceptedEyeFrame": 123456,
        "loadingMenuOpen": false
    },
    "dispatcher": {
        "activeAcquisitionRequestId": null,
        "pendingOperations": 0,
        "queuedManualCaptures": 0,
        "queuedSequenceFrames": 0,
        "activeSequences": 0
    },
    "worker": {
        "running": true,
        "outstandingCaptureJobs": 0,
        "captureJobCapacity": 2,
        "completedArtifacts": 18,
        "failedArtifacts": 0
    },
    "journal": {
        "oldestRetainedEventId": 310,
        "latestEventId": 481,
        "retainedTerminalRequests": 7
    },
    "lastTerminalRequest": {
        "requestId": "a43cdf9a-22be-4899-bad4-7fb0966e084d",
        "state": "completed",
        "terminalUtc": "2026-08-20T04:15:30.402Z"
    }
}
```

Counters are monotonic for the server session unless the capability response
documents a reset action. Readiness timestamps/frame IDs are accompanied by
validity flags when zero is otherwise ambiguous.

## Capture descriptor

Still and sequence frames use one normalized capture descriptor. Saved UI
settings are translated into this descriptor and then frozen.

```json
{
    "source": {
        "kind": "hmd_submission",
        "fallback": "reject"
    },
    "outputs": [
        {
            "view": "framed_combined",
            "dominantEye": "left",
            "width": 2560,
            "height": 1440,
            "crop": null,
            "encoding": {
                "format": "png",
                "colourContract": "sdr_srgb"
            },
            "nameSuffix": "combined"
        },
        {
            "view": "left_eye",
            "encoding": {
                "format": "png",
                "colourContract": "sdr_srgb"
            },
            "nameSuffix": "left"
        },
        {
            "view": "right_eye",
            "encoding": {
                "format": "png",
                "colourContract": "sdr_srgb"
            },
            "nameSuffix": "right"
        }
    ],
    "destination": {
        "policy": "settings_default",
        "directory": null,
        "baseName": null,
        "overwrite": "never"
    },
    "clipboard": "none",
    "tags": {
        "scene": "Riften exterior",
        "state": "enabled"
    }
}
```

Tags are optional evidence labels only. Keys and string values are length-
limited, the total serialized tag payload is bounded, and tags cannot change
paths, scheduling, or feature behavior.

### Source and view are orthogonal

The existing `VRCaptureSource` enum conflates acquisition and composition.
Version 1 separates them:

-   `source.kind = desktop_mirror` observes the desktop backbuffer.
-   `source.kind = hmd_submission` observes coherent accepted OpenVR eye
    submissions before compositor distortion.
-   `source.kind = settings_default` resolves either source from the immutable
    settings snapshot. On flat Skyrim it resolves to `desktop_mirror` even if
    the persisted VR-only preference is `hmd_submission`.
-   `outputs[].view` selects native, individual-eye, side-by-side, or framed
    composition from the acquired planes.

`source_native` means desktop dimensions for desktop capture and the current
side-by-side accepted-eye representation for HMD capture. An unsupported
source/view combination is rejected during validation.

`source.fallback` is `reject` or `desktop_mirror`. The actual source and any
fallback reason must appear in the receipt. Framed views default to `reject`;
silently converting a requested framed HMD view into a desktop image would be
misleading evidence.

Source capabilities are runtime-specific. Flat Skyrim advertises only
`desktop_mirror`; VR also advertises `hmd_submission`. An unavailable explicit
HMD request fails with `source_unavailable` unless the request opts into
`desktop_mirror`, in which case the effective descriptor, receipt, and event
journal preserve the requested source, resolved source, and fallback reason.
For `sequence_start`, the parent receipt contains the fully expanded sequence
descriptor and nests the resolved capture descriptor under `effective.capture`.
Fallback provenance is projected onto the parent receipt and journal as well as
the individual child receipts.

### Outputs

One source acquisition may produce several outputs without restaging the GPU
texture. This is how sequences save separate left/right eyes plus a composed
view. Each artifact has a unique suffix and its own terminal result.

Version 1 supports current lossless PNG and BMP encoders. Other formats must be
capability-advertised before acceptance. `sdr_srgb` includes the current SDR
conversion and sRGB metadata rules. Future HDR/EXR contracts use new explicit
enum values; they must not silently change `sdr_srgb`.

Crop coordinates are normalized and validated within `[0,1]`. Framed views use
their defined framing transform and reject an additional crop unless a future
capability explicitly permits both.

### Destination safety

-   `settings_default` uses the frozen screenshot or frame-sequence folder
    setting. Relative still paths resolve below
    `Pictures\Community Shaders`; relative sequence paths resolve below
    `Videos\Community Shaders`.
-   `game_relative` resolves under the canonical game directory.
-   `absolute` is accepted only when advertised and must be an absolute canonical
    path.
-   Relative traversal outside the selected root is rejected as `unsafe_path`.
-   Sequence acceptance freezes the descriptor and returns `preparing` before
    any path resolution or directory I/O. The preparation worker resolves the
    destination and creates the sequence directory; failure becomes a terminal
    `destination_unavailable` receipt without blocking request or render work.
-   Restricted sequence destinations retain the approved game or Windows capture
    root, then open or create each directory component relative to the previous
    handle. Reparse components, traversal outside the root, more than 256
    components, and conflicting write/delete handles fail preparation before
    creating a sequence directory. Root and intermediate handles prevent rename
    and reparse mutation until publication finishes. Absolute destinations,
    including absolute configured folders, retain their unrestricted policy.
-   `resolvedDirectory` is populated only after the destination lease succeeds
    and records the parent path obtained from its retained handle.
-   The sequence directory is created relative to the already-open destination
    handle by one native create-and-open operation. CSX never reopens the new
    directory by pathname to acquire its lease.
-   Existing files are never overwritten in version 1. `overwrite` must be
    `never`; name collisions receive a deterministic numeric suffix.
-   The worker encodes into memory, creates a sibling temporary file
    exclusively, and retains that handle while it writes, flushes, atomically
    renames without replacement, and verifies the committed file's identity,
    size, and SHA-256 custody.
-   The Win32 rename buffer includes a terminating wide NUL beyond its counted
    filename. Sequence directory handles request directory-list access so
    their no-delete sharing mode actually prevents rename during publication.
    Publication errors distinguish destination-open, identity and path failures.
-   The receipt records both the requested destination policy and resolved path.
-   The API never deletes artifacts.

An empty `baseName` uses the CSX timestamp plus a short request ID. Explicit
names are sanitized, length-limited, and cannot contain path separators.

### Immutable effective descriptor

`capture` may provide a complete descriptor or `useSettings: true` with a
request-scoped patch. A still request expands the current CSX screenshot eye,
format, source, destination, and clipboard settings. A sequence request
expands the distinct frame-capture eye, format, source, destination, frame
count, and cadence settings. The acceptance receipt contains the fully expanded
non-I/O settings descriptor. UI settings changed afterward affect only later
requests. A sequence's initial `preparing` receipt leaves its manifest path null
and omits only `effective.capture.destination.resolvedDirectory`; both are
published after preparation succeeds. Sequence destination validation uses the
frame-capture folder even
when the still-image folder is unavailable. A partial settings load that omits
both `FrameCaptureEye` and legacy `SeparateEyes` preserves the selected eye.
The legacy key migrates only when supplied; a canonical eye always wins.

## Still-capture lifecycle

Still states are:

```text
submitted -> accepted -> waiting_source -> staged -> queued -> encoding
          -> completed
          -> completed_with_warnings

submitted -> rejected
accepted/waiting_source -> cancelled
waiting_source/staged/queued/encoding -> failed
```

`submitted` exists only during command validation. A rejected command has no
server request ID unless an operation record is required for an idempotent
retry response.

Acceptance means options are valid, the feature is enabled, a pending-operation
record was reserved, and the server intends to attempt the capture. It does not
mean a source frame or encoder slot has already been acquired.

Once staging has committed GPU resources to the artifact worker, cancellation
is best-effort. Already committed artifacts may finish and are reported. A
cancelled operation with written artifacts is `cancelled_partial`, not
`cancelled` and not `completed`.

## Sequence contract

A sequence is a parent operation whose child frames use the same capture
descriptor.

Parent states are:

```text
submitted -> accepted -> preparing -> running -> finalizing -> completed
                          |   |        |                 -> completed_with_warnings
                          |   |        |                 -> failed_partial
                          |   +--------+-> stop_requested -> stopped
                          |   +--------+-> cancel_requested -> cancelled
                          |                                 -> cancelled_partial
                          +-> failed (destination unavailable)
```

A stop or cancellation accepted while destination preparation is in flight
retains its requested state. Successful preparation emits `sequence.prepared`
and proceeds directly to finalization without transiently reporting `running`.
It queues only the final manifest, with no redundant partial checkpoint.
Queued preparation can be cancelled before filesystem work starts; its receipt
ends `cancelled` or `stopped`, with a cancelled manifest outcome and null path.
An active synchronous filesystem call must return before its outcome can be
reported. A cancellation or shutdown deadline does not cancel that OS call.

Contract 1.1, schema revision 2, advertises independent destination preparation
and manifest publication lanes. A stalled destination cannot block an existing
sequence's manifest; a stalled manifest cannot block another destination's
preparation. Each lane retains queued jobs, active jobs and undrained results
within its advertised capacity: 64 preparations and 256 publications. Partial
checkpoints stop at 192 outstanding publications, reserving 64 terminal slots.
The public status reports these outstanding counts and admission closure.
New sequence admission also closes at 256 retired manifest snapshots waiting
for the publication worker. At most the 64 already pending operations can add
their snapshots afterward. This bounds retained chains when publication stalls.

Shutdown closes preparation admission, retires queued preparations without
filesystem work and allows terminal manifests to drain. `DrainForShutdown`
returns false at its caller deadline while unresolved I/O remains outstanding.
Destruction gives both workers one shared two-second deadline. A worker still
in synchronous I/O retains isolated shared state after that deadline and
finishes when the OS call returns; the timeout is logged and is never a claim
that the operation was cancelled. Worker state and immutable manifest snapshots
do not refer back to the destroyed coordinator.

Failed destination preparation retires the sequence immediately. Its terminal
receipt has zero scheduled/written frames, a `destination_unavailable` error,
and a failed manifest outcome with a null path when a manifest was requested.
No manifest job is queued without a directory lease. Public active-sequence
counts and the recording indicator exclude this failed sequence.

Every parent terminal state includes counts and a manifest outcome. A sequence
cannot be terminal-success while any child frame remains in a mutable state.

### Scheduling

-   `game_frames` uses CSX's monotonic engine render-frame counter. It is the
    deterministic default and maps the existing `SequenceFrameInterval` setting.
-   `wall_clock` uses monotonic elapsed time, not local calendar time. Capture
    occurs at the next eligible render opportunity; no exact-time guarantee is
    made.
-   A finite `frameCount` is required in version 1 unless capabilities advertise
    `untilStopped`. Even then a maximum duration is mandatory.
-   `pausePolicy = hold` does not advance the schedule while no eligible rendered
    frame is observed. A future `skip` policy may count missed wall-clock slots as
    dropped frames.
-   The scheduler records requested slot, actual engine frame, compositor cycle,
    monotonic timestamp, UTC timestamp, and lateness.

The scheduler never reserves all future encoder slots. At each eligible slot it
attempts one child capture. This preserves bounded memory with the current
worker limit and permits manual still captures between sequence frames.

### Backpressure

Version 1 policies are:

-   `skip`: record a dropped child frame with `encoder_backpressure` or
    `source_busy`, then continue.
-   `abort`: stop scheduling on the first capacity miss and finalize partial
    output as failed.

There is intentionally no unbounded `queue` policy. A later adaptive policy may
delay wall-clock scheduling but must be explicitly named because it changes
timing semantics.

Manual/UI still requests and sequences share a fair dispatcher. A sequence may
have only one child in source acquisition at a time. The coordinator must
prevent a high-frequency sequence from starving manual requests.

Manual captures retain FIFO order and their arbitration turn while retrying
source contention or encoder backpressure, up to a ten-second dispatch
deadline. A completed attempt hands the next turn to the other class.
Sequence capacity misses are immediately recorded as dropped children so
the requested `skip` or `abort` policy applies at the missed slot.

### Failure and stop behavior

`failurePolicy` is `continue` or `abort`.

-   `sequence_stop` is graceful: stop creating new child frames, finish committed
    artifacts, write the final manifest, and report `stopped` or
    `completed_with_warnings`.
-   `request_cancel` is immediate best-effort: cancel unscheduled and waiting
    children, allow irreversible writes to finish, and finalize
    `cancelled`/`cancelled_partial`.
-   Disabling the screenshot feature behaves as immediate cancellation for
    source acquisition. It does not abandon committed worker writes.
-   Device loss, runtime source loss, or worker shutdown must finalize a partial
    manifest rather than leave the sequence indistinguishable from success.

### Frame-set output

Each sequence owns a unique directory:

```text
CS_sequence_<complete-request-id>/
  sequence.json.partial
  frame_000001_combined.png
  frame_000001_left.png
  frame_000001_right.png
  ...
  sequence.json
  preview.mp4                 # optional post-capture artifact
```

`sequence.json.partial` is updated atomically at bounded checkpoints, not after
every pixel write. On normal finalization it becomes `sequence.json`. Recovery
can identify an interrupted sequence from the partial manifest and preserved
frames.

Manifest snapshots are immutable. Both document assembly and retirement of
retained child snapshots run on the manifest worker. Retirement releases the
chain iteratively, including when requests are acknowledged or expire, so
long sequences cannot cause recursive destruction on the render path.

The final manifest includes:

-   contract and CSX identities;
-   request/client IDs and the accepted command identity;
-   requested and effective sequence/capture descriptors;
-   start/end times and frame counters;
-   scheduled, acquired, written, dropped, failed, and cancelled counts;
-   one child record per scheduled ordinal;
-   source/fallback, dimensions, format, colour contract, sequence-relative
    path, byte size, and SHA-256 custody for every artifact;
-   backpressure, failure, cancellation, and warning details;
-   preview packaging request and outcome.

Large manifests remain on disk. DevBench receipts return counts, recent
failures, and the manifest path; `request_get` supports paginated child summaries
rather than returning thousands of frames in one MCP response.

`requested`, `effective`, and `actual` are separate normative objects. A source
or view fallback is therefore durable sequence evidence rather than an
in-memory warning only. The schema requires child warning/error arrays and the
actual view, dimensions, format, and colour contract for every committed frame
artifact. A missing required final manifest is `failed` or `failed_partial`; it
is never reported as completion with a warning.

The parent receipt and every partial or final manifest carry the same frozen,
fully expanded sequence object in `effective`. Capture settings remain nested
under `effective.capture`; they are not substituted for the sequence object in
manifest output.

Frame artifact paths are strict descendants of the sequence directory and are
published relative to that directory. Consumers must reject rooted paths,
traversal, reparse-point escapes, request-identity mismatches, and artifacts
whose current size or SHA-256 differs from the final manifest.

### Optional video packaging

Frame-set completion is independent of video packaging. If preview video is
requested:

1. Frame capture and the primary manifest finalize first.
2. An advertised post-capture packager reads committed frame artifacts.
3. Packaging state is `not_requested`, `unsupported`, `queued`, `running`,
   `completed`, or `failed`.
4. `required = false` allows the sequence to complete with a packaging warning.
5. `required = true` makes packaging failure a terminal sequence failure while
   preserving all frames and the manifest.
6. Packager command/version, codec, container, FPS, exit status, output size,
   and hash are recorded.

No encoder may consume D3D resources directly or hold up the sequence scheduler.
An unavailable video encoder is reported during validation when `required` is
true and as an explicit unsupported optional component when false.

## Events and acknowledgements

Every state transition writes a journal event with a process-wide monotonic
`eventId`, request-local `eventIndex`, request ID, type, timestamp, and payload.

Core event types are:

-   `request.accepted`
-   `request.cancel_requested`
-   `source.waiting`
-   `source.acquired`
-   `source.fallback`
-   `source.timeout`
-   `artifact.queued`
-   `artifact.encoding`
-   `artifact.written`
-   `artifact.failed`
-   `sequence.frame_scheduled`
-   `sequence.frame_dropped`
-   `sequence.stop_requested`
-   `sequence.finalizing`
-   `packaging.queued`
-   `packaging.completed`
-   `packaging.failed`
-   `request.terminal`

`events_poll` takes `afterEventId`, optional `requestId`, and a bounded `limit`.
It is non-blocking in version 1. The result returns events plus `nextEventId`,
`oldestRetainedEventId`, and `moreAvailable`. If a client cursor predates
retention, the response includes `cursor_expired` and directs the client to
`request_get` for current receipts.

There are two distinct acknowledgements:

1. **Server acceptance acknowledgement** is the successful response to
   `capture` or `sequence_start`. It contains the request ID, state, effective
   descriptor, and first event ID.
2. **Client receipt acknowledgement** is the `acknowledge` action. It records
   that a client has received events through an event ID or has received the
   terminal receipt for a request.

Acknowledgement never cancels work, deletes artifacts, or changes success. It
allows early journal compaction. Terminal receipts remain until acknowledged or
the advertised retention limit expires. Terminal manifests on disk are not
removed by journal expiry.

## Receipts

`request_get` returns a stable receipt shape for stills and sequences:

```json
{
    "requestId": "a43cdf9a-22be-4899-bad4-7fb0966e084d",

        ]
    },

    },
    "lastEventId": 481
}
```

Input-plane format, dimensions, colour space, submitted bounds, orientation,
tonemap decision, and device generation are recorded when known. Timings are
diagnostic monotonic durations with a documented measurement boundary; they are
not substituted for GPU profiler measurements.

Hashes may be capability-controlled because large frame sequences can make
hashing material. If omitted, `hashState` explains `disabled`, `pending`, or
`failed`; absence must not ambiguously mean success.

## Settings contract and migration

Request-scoped capture descriptors never mutate settings. Settings actions use
an explicit scope:

-   `runtime_session`: applies until restart or a later settings load.
-   `persistent_user`: updates the feature settings and invokes the normal CSX
    persistence path. The receipt reports the file/save acknowledgement.

`settings_apply` defaults to no scope and is rejected until the caller states
one. This prevents an automation typo from silently becoming a permanent user
preference.

The canonical settings add `ScreenshotSettingsSchemaVersion` and a nested
sequence object:

```json
{
    "ScreenshotSettingsSchemaVersion": 2,
    "Enabled": true,
    "ScreenshotPath": "Screenshots",
    "SdrUsePng": true,
    "ScreenshotEye": "Left",
    "CopyToClipboard": false,
    "VRCaptureSource": "HMDSubmission",
    "VRFramedView": "Left",
    "VRFramedDominantEye": "Left",
    "FrameCapturePath": "Frame Captures",
    "FrameCaptureUsePng": false,
    "FrameCaptureEye": "Both",
    "Sequence": {
        "FrameCount": 30,
        "Schedule": {
            "Basis": "GameFrames",
            "IntervalFrames": 6,
            "PausePolicy": "Hold"
        },
        "Outputs": {
            "SeparateEyes": true
        },
        "Packaging": {
            "PreviewVideo": {
                "Requested": false,
                "FramesPerSecond": 15
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Migration rules:

1. Continue reading `VRFramedEye` as the existing compatibility alias.
2. Read the current flat `SequenceFrameCount`, `SequenceFrameInterval`,
   `SequencePreviewFramesPerSecond`, `SequenceSaveSeparateEyes`, and
   `SequenceWritePreviewVideo` keys when the nested object is absent.
3. Nested version-2 values win when both forms exist.
4. Save the canonical nested object. Unified preset generation is updated in
   the same change so dead flat keys are not reintroduced.
5. Unknown future settings fields are preserved where the existing settings
   framework permits, but ignored by an older runtime.
6. Invalid persisted values fall back to documented safe defaults and produce
   one structured warning; they must not create an unbounded sequence.

The menu gains still and sequence controls using the same validator as the API.
It shows active request ID, counts, stop/cancel, most recent terminal outcome,
manifest path, and optional packaging outcome. Manual controls must never claim
success merely because a request was accepted.

## Error codes

Version 1 reserves these stable codes:

| Code                           | Typical phase     | Retryable                        |

| `composition_failed`           | encoding          | Depends on requested fallback    |
| `encode_failed`                | encoding          | Maybe                            |
| `unsafe_output_collision`      | commit            | No until destination changes     |
| `write_failed`                 | commit            | Maybe                            |

| `packager_unavailable`         | packaging         | No for current process           |
| `packaging_failed`             | packaging         | Maybe                            |
| `cancelled`                    | any mutable phase | Caller-controlled                |
| `internal_error`               | any               | Maybe                            |
| `cursor_expired`               | event read        | Yes via `request_get`            |
| `request_not_found`            | lookup            | No or expired                    |

An error records its phase, whether retry is safe, field when applicable,
request/artifact/frame IDs, and structured details. Sequence frame errors do
not become parent errors unless the selected failure policy says so.

## Threading and lifecycle rules

1. DevBench parses JSON and performs non-game validation off the game thread.
2. Main-thread work is limited to safe feature state transitions and snapshots.
3. Render hooks acquire and stage only the current eligible source.
4. The artifact worker owns mapping, CPU image work, encoding, hashing, disk
   commit, and worker outcome publication.
5. The RequestJournal is thread-safe and never calls game or D3D APIs.
6. No MCP call blocks the game thread waiting for a future frame.
7. Worker outcome callbacks update the journal even when no client is connected.
8. On shutdown, stop accepting work, cancel source-waiting operations, drain
   committed writes for a bounded interval, and write partial sequence
   manifests. Never detach a worker that still owns feature memory.
9. On device replacement, invalidate unstaged source work. Do not reuse textures
   from a previous device generation.
10. Disabling capture cancels acquisition and sequence scheduling; committed
    encoder work remains owned until terminal.

## Obsolete compatibility behavior

The old `communityshaders.menu` action `{"action":"screenshot"}` is obsolete
and scheduled for removal after a migration window. While retained, it
delegates to `capture` with the current settings. Its response preserves the
existing `action`, `path`, and menu `status` fields, adds `delegatedRequest`
containing the screenshot request ID and acceptance receipt, and adds explicit
`deprecation` metadata naming `communityshaders.screenshot`, contract major 1,
action `capture` as the replacement. New clients must use
`communityshaders.screenshot` directly.

An obsolete-action response includes migration metadata alongside its normal
compatibility response:

```json
{
    "action": "screenshot",
    "delegatedRequest": { "ok": true, "request": { "requestId": "..." } },
    "deprecation": {
        "obsolete": true,
        "message": "communityshaders.menu screenshot is obsolete; migrate to communityshaders.screenshot contractMajor 1",
        "replacement": {
            "tool": "communityshaders.screenshot",
            "contractMajor": 1,
            "action": "capture"
        }
    }
}
```

Removal must not occur before at least one published migration release has
carried this notice. Before removal, repeat the repository and automation-tool
call-site audit for `communityshaders.menu` plus action `screenshot`, and record
the removal in the release notes. Absence of known clients is not, by itself, a
reason to skip the migration release.

The native screenshot settings button and screenshot hotkey use
`ScreenshotFeature::RequestUiCapture()`. That adapter dispatches through the
same public `CSX::ScreenshotAPI::Interface001` entry point as native mods. It is
not coupled to the obsolete menu action. Code requiring a receipt uses
`RequestApiCapture()` and its returned JSON or calls the versioned service
directly.

The legacy general CSAP vtable remains unchanged. Screenshot consumers query
the separately negotiated `csx.screenshot` service and use fixed-width POD
transport structures plus UTF-8 JSON. Do not append a broad
screenshot surface to the upscaling-oriented interface; screenshot evolves
independently behind its own service major.

-   VR desktop mirror, accepted-eye side-by-side, framed left, framed right,
    framed combined, and separate-eye outputs.
-   Main menu, gameplay, loading-screen rejection/fallback, paused game, and menu
    open/closed.
-   Null HMD for repeatable automation and physical HMD for actual compositor,
    pose, projection, and driver behavior.
-   Hotkey, menu, DevBench direct tool, DevBench scenario dispatch, reconnect and
    idempotent retry.
-   Burst stills and sequences at/over worker capacity with stable frame pacing.
-   Feature disable, game exit, device reset, full disk, unwritable directory,
    and unavailable optional packager.
-   Verify every claimed artifact by existence, size, decodability, dimensions,
    and receipt/manifest identity.

## Implementation order

1. Freeze JSON request, response, event, receipt, and sequence-manifest schemas;
   add golden contract tests.
2. Introduce IDs, normalized descriptors, RequestJournal, and pure state-machine
   helpers without changing capture output.
3. Wrap the current still pipeline in ScreenshotCoordinator; make worker success
   and every failure path publish structured outcomes.
4. Add `communityshaders.screenshot` capabilities, status, capture,
   request/event, cancellation, and acknowledgement actions.
5. Delegate the menu action and UI/hotkey to the coordinator.
6. Add SequenceScheduler, child frame receipts, backpressure/failure policies,
   partial and final manifests, and graceful stop.
7. Add multi-output/separate-eye artifact processing from one staged source.
8. Implement version-2 settings migration and full menu sequence controls;
   update unified presets in the same commit.
9. Add optional offline preview-video packaging behind capability discovery.
10. Complete null-HMD and physical-HMD qualification before freezing contract
    major 1 for external consumers.

## Definition of done

The screenshot API and sequence feature are complete when:

-   no accepted operation can disappear without a terminal receipt;
-   command retries cannot create duplicate captures;
-   all current worker failures map to structured terminal outcomes;
-   still capture retains current flat/VR output correctness;
-   a sequence produces a recoverable frame set and final manifest without
    unbounded queues or render-thread encoding;
-   separate-eye and composed outputs accurately report what was written;
-   stop, cancel, disable, device loss, and shutdown have tested partial-result
    semantics;
-   capabilities and version negotiation are authoritative;
-   UI, hotkey, menu DevBench alias, and direct DevBench tool share one service;
-   legacy sequence settings migrate and are no longer inert;
-   contract schemas, tests, documentation, null-HMD qualification, and physical-
    HMD qualification agree with the shipped implementation.

## Production build boundary

`DEVBENCH_BRIDGE=OFF` excludes native burst plans, atlas staging, deferred
encoding, continuity bookkeeping, golden-reference callbacks and their
per-frame notification/encoder locks. It also excludes the
`Screenshot::SequenceCapture` diagnostic pass. These paths are absent from
production translation units, rather than disabled by a runtime setting.
`TRACY_SUPPORT=ON` alone does not enable them.

Normal screenshot and scheduled-sequence behavior remains available through
the menu, hotkey and native API. Its PNG/BMP encoder, collision-safe file
publication, UTF-8 path conversion and shared retry handling are functional
production code. The shared retry fix applies only when an API command is
dispatched; it does not poll or add a render-loop hook.

Validation on 2026-10-01:

-   Built the universal SE/AE/VR Release DLL with `TRACY_SUPPORT=OFF` and
    `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE=OFF` using
    `pwsh ./tools/cmake.ps1 --build build/ALL --config Release --target CommunityShaders --parallel 2`.
    The initial compile exposed an indirect `StringUtils.h` dependency;
    adding the direct include resolved it. No packaging or deployment ran.
-   Verified the production target has no Tracy definitions/client linkage or
    DevBench definition. The DLL excludes 14 burst/reference markers and the
    10 diagnostic markers from the preceding production-boundary check.
    Its adjacent manifest matches its SHA-256 and 23,545,856-byte size.
-   The preserved pre-commit build is based on `95e8d4c67` plus this source
    patch, with Build ID
    `def80f0b5d3a5315a9d67ccd6842bc63c3f61c634e04701b7fd8db295eb7bb57`
    and DLL SHA-256
    `4d77a34efa92280fa356f1f0917be3b8240480bcc02c5a5cfbce0900fd60e349`.
-   MSVC `/Zs` passed for `ScreenshotApi.cpp`, `ScreenshotFeature.cpp` and
    `ScreenshotDevBenchBridge.cpp` with `TRACY_SUPPORT`, `TRACY_ENABLE`,
    `TRACY_ON_DEMAND` and `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE_ENABLED` defined. The bridge check
    used the installed DevBench SDK include directory.
-   All 10 tests selected by
    `ctest --test-dir build/ALL -C Release -R 'Screenshot|ApiServiceFoundation' --output-on-failure --no-tests=error --parallel 2`
    passed after building their nine executable targets. This includes both
    production and DevBench capability/admission variants, flat and VR source
    discovery, ordinary PNG/BMP capabilities, native pixel round trips, burst
    policy, reference receipts and retry handling.
-   No in-game capture or performance measurement was performed. Local build
    and binary-check evidence is under
    `build/validation/capture-boundary-20261001/`.

## Consecutive native-region bursts

For temporal quality, opt into `sequence.burst` in a CSX build configured with
`DEVBENCH_BRIDGE=ON`. Require the `burst` capability before sending this
descriptor. Production builds omit that capability and reject `sequence.burst`
with a non-retryable `unsupported` error before allocating capture resources.
Ordinary still PNG and streamed sequence behavior remain available in every
build. The same burst descriptor is accepted by the comparison builds of CSX
and Open Shaders:

```json
"burst": {
    "maximumBytes": 536870912,
    "regions": [
        { "x": 564, "y": 712, "width": 384, "height": 256 },
        { "x": 944, "y": 712, "width": 384, "height": 256 },
        { "x": 1128, "y": 1040, "width": 384, "height": 256 }
    ]
}
```

Coordinates above only illustrate the descriptor for a sufficiently large
eye image. Select center, mask-boundary and periphery rectangles from the
full native reference for the actual projection; do not assume those
example positions track the FOV mask on every machine. The coordinates are
integer pixels relative to each oriented submission, applied identically
to both eyes. All regions must have equal widths. Each eye's regions stack
vertically in array order; VR places the left atlas before the right atlas.
There is no scaling, filtering or padding. The example yields 768 x 768
pixels containing six 384 x 256 tiles. Bounds, orientation, source
dimensions and region definitions remain in the manifest.

Use explicit `frameCount` (1–240), `useSettings: false`, `game_frames`,
`intervalFrames: 1`, one `side_by_side` output in VR (`source_native` on
SE/AE), SDR PNG or BMP, and `fallback: reject`. Keep the frame manifest
enabled. Omit `failurePolicy` for a shared request: the burst always stops
acquisition on failure regardless of the ordinary sequence default.
Additional output cropping, resizing and clipboard export are unavailable
in this mode. Bursts require exclusive ownership through finalization.

Only cropped GPU copies are collected during acquisition. Readback and
PNG/BMP encoding start after acquisition ends; saved images use the same
existing encoders and verified publication paths as ordinary captures.
Admission checks the entire raw payload before allocating any textures.
Its ceiling is 512 MiB, with 128 MiB per frame and at most eight regions;
native texture and region bounds are also checked at acquisition. These
are resource bounds, not wall-clock deadlines. Driver allocation padding,
metadata and bounded readback/encoder scratch space are additional memory.
Acquisition does not wait for the disk or encoder to make room.

The receipt and final manifest expose `continuity`: observed first/last
engine frames, acquired/requested counts, `failure`, and `complete`.
Every acquired frame must advance the engine counter and, in VR, the
compositor cycle by exactly one. A missing or incompatible eye, source
change, pause after capture begins, readback failure or failed publication
prevents qualification. Early stop retains acquired images but cannot
qualify an incomplete requested burst. Require final manifest publication,
all requested images and `continuity.complete == true` together; image
count or a successful start response alone is insufficient. Memory owned
by each frame is released during drain; receipts retain metadata only.

For a compact comparison, preserve one full stereo reference at each
existing viewpoint, then initially capture two seconds: 0.5 seconds of
stationary detail, a one-second repeatable pan, and 0.5 seconds of stationary
recovery. At a measured 60 rendered FPS this is 30 + 60 + 30 = 120 frames.
Three 384 x 256 regions per eye consume 283,115,520 raw bytes per viewpoint
(270 MiB, about 1.70 GB over six viewpoints), before lossless compression.
This is an initial evidence budget, not a claim that all temporal artifacts
settle within two seconds. Extend only the affected phase if the saved
samples show an unsettled trail, insufficient motion or an unresolved
fluctuation; do not routinely repeat the entire viewpoint or capture at
the 240-frame ceiling. Stabilize camera and history before acquisition.

Both builds require an explicit burst frame count. Choose it from actual
rendered cadence, not the nominal HMD refresh rate, and match motion speed
and phase durations between builds. The selected frame count ends source
acquisition; it is not an encoding, publication or command timeout. Keep
requested raw bytes within the advertised bound; reduce region dimensions
if the chosen cadence would exceed it. Retain acquisition timestamps and
correlated DevBench camera actions for phase boundaries. Match the original
settings, fixed HMD pose, viewpoint, game time and weather.

Validate the first short burst's continuity, stereo orientation, crop
locations and publication before proceeding to the other viewpoints. Reuse
that valid burst. Do not repeatedly capture long full-frame sequences or
include image collection in a performance benchmark. Consecutive counters
do not prove negligible capture overhead or uniform wall-clock cadence;
inspect timestamps before comparing shimmer, ghosting and stereo history.
Runtime qualification on VR and one flat runtime remains necessary.

DevBench already supports capture-provider registration through
`RegisterToolExtension("capture", key, ...)`, with correlated `outputPath`,
`requestId` and `capture.ready` completion. Its base `capture` accepts
`golden`, `threshold` and normalized `regions`; replay accepts per-checkpoint
`goldens`. Reuse those facilities and existing matching reference images
instead of creating another golden-sample registry. Full-frame goldens
and burst atlases have different layouts and must not be compared directly.

CSX registers the native Screenshot provider as `kind: "communityshaders"`
on DevBench build 10500 or newer. Discover it using
`capture {"kind":"providers"}`. It captures a full same-cycle stereo PNG
in VR or native desktop PNG on SE/AE through the existing screenshot queue.
The host's exact absolute output path is retained; existing files are
refused and publication never overwrites or silently chooses another name.
Completion carries the host request ID, dimensions, size and SHA-256 from
the committed-file receipt through `capture.ready`. Failure and cancellation
cannot report a successful reference. The provider reports
`uiExcluded: false`; hide the HUD/menu explicitly for matching references.
Use the base capture tool's `golden`, `threshold` and `regions` arguments
or replay checkpoint `goldens` for DevBench's existing scoring.

### Burst and golden-provider validation (2026-09-30)

The universal SE/AE/VR DLL built with Tracy and DevBench enabled from the
implementation worktree based on `2467ba77cbfc1ed886a062cdea27b4f031b864ba`.
The isolated build disabled automatic deployment and used cached dependencies.

```powershell
pwsh ./tools/cmake.ps1 --build build/c930b --config Release --target CommunityShaders screenshot_native_png_test screenshot_manifest_snapshot_test screenshot_settings_test screenshot_api_policy_test screenshot_capture_present_test --parallel 8
ctest --test-dir build/c930b -C Release -R Screenshot --output-on-failure
```

All eight screenshot tests passed. Coverage includes native atlas pixel
identity under all four orientations, bounds and memory budgets, frame/cycle
gaps, terminal publication requirements, Unicode reference paths and
failure/cancellation receipts. Existing atomic-storage and capture/dispatch
checks passed. The settings extraction harness now includes the production
capture-descriptor exception instead of depending on a missing declaration.
The shared burst policy is byte-identical to the OS implementation.

The adversarial/DRY pass checked source pairing, allocation limits, worker
ownership, cancellation, exact host filenames, callback lock boundaries and
normal PNG publication. The provider reuses the queue and committed-file
receipt; neither the encoder nor the terminated Win32 rename buffer changed.
Path conversion is shared through `Util::PathToUtf8`, including publication
logging. An unchanged deferral state no longer wakes the encoder each frame.

Scoped hooks, discovery JSON parsing and sequence-manifest schema validation
passed. The request schema retains its existing layout to avoid unrelated
whole-file formatting; its new burst definition was parsed and reviewed.
No runtime images, golden scores, sustained-cadence measurements or capture
overhead measurements were produced. VR and one flat runtime still need
in-game qualification with these DLLs before temporal comparisons are valid.

The follow-up adversarial pass made golden captures use the burst path's
strict native-source checks: single-sample SDR8, valid submitted bounds,
same-frame/cycle eyes, compatible dimensions and no desktop-source fallback
or HDR tonemapping. Ordinary still captures retain their existing behavior.
Comparison guidance starts with a two-second cropped burst after history
stabilization, extending only an unresolved phase instead of recording at
the maximum frame count. No publication deadline is derived from its length.

Native bursts and golden outputs also retain display-encoded bytes when
an sRGB texture tag reaches DirectXTex conversion. The production helper
changes format metadata before the existing SDR writer; ordinary capture
conversion is unchanged. `ScreenshotNativePng` verifies exact PNG and BMP
pixel round trips across RGBA/BGRA and UNORM/sRGB sources (4,096 pixels),
and rejects HDR input. The existing NUL-terminated atomic publisher remains
unchanged. The focused CMake target addition keeps the surrounding legacy
formatting intact; CMake regeneration and the new target build passed.

### Retrying rejected commands

A failed dispatch with `error.retryable: true`, including temporary capture
`busy` responses, is not retained in the completed command cache. Retry
with the same arguments, `clientId` and `commandId` after the temporary
condition clears. Successful commands and non-retryable failures remain
cached; retries of accepted captures return their receipt without starting
another capture. Concurrent identical commands remain `command_in_progress`.
