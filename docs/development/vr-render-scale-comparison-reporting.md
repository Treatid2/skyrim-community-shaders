# Upscaling and render-scale comparison reporting

The separate physical-HMD [PR qualification](render-scale-pr-qualification.md)
currently uses `csx-render-scale-pr-v1` revision 6.

Every update to the existing
[numbered ledger record](vr-render-scale-ledger.md) includes the
detailed comparison below automatically. Do this after measurements and
owned-capture cleanup, without adding work between measured transitions.
The user decides whether to include this analysis in a PR. Do not publish
it automatically or make it a PR requirement or merge gate. The separate
release-qualification protocol retains its own existing requirements.

## Immutable numbered ledgers

Create `vr-render-scale-ledger-NNNN-prNUMBER.csv` in this directory for
every finalized measurement, including repeated measurements on the same
PR. Advance the global number from the highest existing version. A new PR
also gets a new number when its measurements are published. Never replace
an earlier numbered file or continue one ever-growing mutable CSV.

Each snapshot contains only the selected baseline runs and measurements
belonging to the PR that commits it. Preserve complete run columns,
including both passes, interrupted segments and structured detail cells.
Copy baseline cells exactly; do not summarize them or carry unrelated PR
history into a new snapshot. Record the baseline selection and build/run
identities in the report. Include the snapshot and index update in its PR.
Keep earlier snapshots unchanged and reference them for historical work.

The [index](vr-render-scale-ledger.md) records the initial three-file
migration. Files `0001` and `0002` are balanced historical archives; `0003`
contains the selected PR65/PR66 baselines and latest measured PR73 run.
Future numbers start at `0004`. All are ordinary CSV files. Keep each below
100 MiB; if a PR needs multiple files, partition whole run columns across
consecutive numbers carrying that same PR identity and list them together
in the index. Never discard fields to meet the size limit.

The comparison wrapper defaults to the highest numbered file. Use
`--ledger <snapshot.csv>` to pin a version and repeat
`--ledger-archive <historical.csv>` for additional disjoint run partitions
needed by a comparison. Duplicate run columns are rejected as ambiguous.
The wrapper hashes archives, audits timings across the selected files,
and refuses to overwrite a numbered ledger through `--ledger-candidate`.
Raw per-run evidence stays in the ignored `artifacts/` directory.

## Separate results from assessment

Never use one PASS/FAIL label to summarize everything:

| Dimension           | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution           | COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE, or INTERRUPTED; counts and missing segments                         |
| Terminal result     | Original per-transition render/waiter result, explicitly scoped to the terminal condition |
| Task 2              | Original per-transition classifications and counts; no aggregate verdict                  |
| Full-history health | Every observed failure, recovery, retry, applicable gate failure, and evidence gap        |
| Change assessment   | IMPROVEMENT_SUPPORTED, NEUTRAL_SUPPORTED, DOES_NOT_MEET_STANDARD, or INCONCLUSIVE         |
| Reporting           | Whether the required evidence and analysis are complete                                   |

`DOES_NOT_MEET_STANDARD` means that the observed result does not support an
improvement-or-neutral assessment. It does **not** mean the test failed to
run. Preserve actual failed terminal results too: a later recovery must not
erase them. A terminal PASS does not erase recovered fidelity mismatches,
vendor fallback, lifecycle failures, or retries within the measured window.

Do not use the fixed two-frame stretch cutoff as a health or improvement
gate when settling imposes the stretch. Preserve the producer's raw gate,
label it `DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY`, and compare the measured episode count, total
frames and duration instead. The updated producer marks this gate
`diagnostic_only` and excludes it from capture acceptance. An older schema-v13
receipt is interpreted as diagnostic only when the named two-frame gate has
no classification, `diagnosticThresholdFrames` is absent, and legacy
`maximumAcceptedFrames` is two; its raw failed result and raw rejection remain
visible. Unknown classifications or schema versions fail closed. The producer
retains `maximumAcceptedFrames` for old readers and adds
`diagnosticThresholdFrames` with the same value.
Historical comparison also accepts schema-v13 records with those explicit
diagnostic fields. Neither v13 form qualifies for revision-6 PR qualification,
which requires v14 for every assay and its baseline.
Schema v14 additionally records each completed episode's frame range, QPC
range, transition epoch, and submit-path reason mask. Its
`presentation_stretch_attribution` health gate rejects missing or incoherent
trace coverage and unattributed frames. Keep that gate distinct from the raw
two-frame diagnostic in comparisons.
Only the named two-frame gate may use `diagnostic_only`; that classification
on any other gate is rejected. Unclassified other gates remain health gates.
Likewise, a
scaled-presentation gate that
rejects `NativeOriginal` after a **proven** native-AA target is a labeled
`CONTRACT_MISMATCH`; retain its observed values and native both-eye proof.
Do not apply that exception without the exact native terminal evidence.
Other failed gates remain applicable unless their contract is separately
shown to be inapplicable. Report new, persistent, and resolved findings.

## Automatic workflow at each ledger update

1. Pin the user-selected reference. Otherwise select the previous relevant
   measured main-VR run from the canonical ledger, not the current checkout
   or an unrelated newer run. State the selection. Keep any specifically
   requested older renderer baseline as an additional comparison.
2. Preserve immutable raw evidence and verify each producer, Build ID,
   compiled source, stress session, request, epoch and indexed receipt hash.
   Record renderer base and exact main-VR base/equivalence separately from
   the compiled source when a reporting bridge was backported. Supply a
   provenance file with the source audit or Git evidence; unknown is `n/a`.
3. Prepare the next numbered ledger from retained measurements. Use the repository
   wrapper below once to finalize the candidate when needed, validate and
   audit the prepared snapshot, and generate the comparison. The installed plugin may
   lag the maintained source; use the explicit toolkit source path until
   its release is installed. Do not rotate a plugin during another run.
4. Populate the new snapshot with every measured timing and all
   finalized transition, pass and health details, including interrupted
   segments. Apply the complete-ledger contract below. Never replace
   earlier snapshots or alter retained cells. The same wrapper invocation
   verifies all selected numeric timing cells and historical-cell preservation
   before publishing a prepared snapshot. Also verify complete field coverage;
   the numeric timing audit alone does not establish ledger completeness.
   Pass the new file with `--ledger` and audit it
   once. Do not generate a throwaway comparison before updating the ledger.
5. Add the compact per-pass assessment, affected routes, complete detailed
   side-by-side tables and evidence links to the durable run report and
   [iteration record](vr-render-scale-iteration.md). Do not finish a ledger
   update with only averages, a terminal PASS count, or a local file link.
   Keep unavailable data and unmatched runs explicit; retain useful partial
   comparisons without inventing timings or a neutral result.

```powershell
python tools/compare-render-scale-ledger.py `
  --toolkit-root <automation-source-or-package-root> `
  --node <node-executable> `
  --baseline-root <preserved-baseline-run> `
  --candidate-root <preserved-candidate-run> `
  --provenance-path <comparison-provenance.json> `
  --output-root <new-local-comparison-directory>
```

Without the optional finalization and ledger-update arguments, the wrapper
is read-only with respect to runs and the canonical ledger.
Its generated Markdown, JSON and CSV contain both builds, every pass and
transition, unmatched entries, full gate observations, and telemetry. Keep
raw trees local. The comparison export supplements the existing ledger.

### Fast routine completion

Keep the same output directory when repeating a command. The wrapper checks
content hashes of all raw inputs, summaries/indexes, provenance, policy,
toolkit JavaScript and protocol matrices, its own implementation, Node, and
generated outputs.
Unchanged comparisons are reused; changed or missing inputs/outputs force
regeneration. Ledger timing validation always runs, using one metric index
instead of rescanning the whole CSV for each timing. Cache validity is not
based on timestamps, an old PASS label, or file size alone.

For a newly completed candidate, add `--finalize-candidate <request.json>`.
When the installed plugin lags the maintained parser, use this argument
together with `--toolkit-root <corrected-automation-source-root>`. The live
worker records the journal without finalizing it. Selecting a corrected
toolkit alone changes comparison code but does not reconstruct an existing
summary. Finalize from the preserved journal with the corrected source;
never replay measurements to repair an older reporter's event vocabulary.
The request contains `variant`, `runId`, `buildId`, and `expectedRows`, with
optional `artifactPath`, `manifestPath`, and `generatedUtc`. Supply the exact
physical DLL and adjacent manifest paths for deployment verification when
needed. When present, worker state must be terminal, cleanup verified, and
pending evidence zero. Finalization writes to that candidate directory;
historical evidence replay must use a separate copy. Only unchanged inputs,
deployment files, and all five hashed finalizer outputs permit reuse. This
includes the full scalar CSV: no values or journal revisions are dropped.

For a prepared numbered snapshot, pass `--ledger <new-snapshot.csv>`.
Verify its selected baseline and retained PR columns against their source
snapshots, then run the complete coverage and timing audit once. The
legacy `--ledger-candidate` and `--expected-ledger-sha256` options remain
available only for unnumbered staging files; they cannot publish over a
numbered snapshot. Unexpected ledger or archive changes fail closed;
inspect a retained ownership lock before recovery.

`reporting-performance.json` retains stage durations, reuse decisions,
classification, and any failure; `ledger-validation.json` retains the exact
timing audit. Reporting limitations from finalization remain explicit and
separate from the ledger audit result. `--quiet` suppresses routine stdout,
not error exits or recorded findings. Brief useful progress lines are fine;
avoid unnecessary narration, polling, repeated extraction, tool maintenance,
packaging, regression suites, or ad-hoc report rewriting during an ordinary
run. Revisit checks only for changed inputs/code, failures or unresolved
concerns. Never omit full evidence, comparison tables, or required checks to
meet a time target. This command prepares local reports; it does not publish
to PRs or replace the required durable report/iteration update.

The provenance file has `baseline` and `candidate` objects, each containing
`sourceCommit`, `rendererBaseCommit`, `mainVRBaseCommit`, and `evidence`.
Use full hashes and cite the verification/audit; never infer an equivalent
main-VR commit from a branch name. The tool checks the compiled source
against the retained manifest and producer receipts.

## Complete-ledger contract

The canonical ledger is the complete durable run record. Every available
result belongs in the ledger itself; a report or local evidence link cannot
stand in for an omitted field. This applies to complete and interrupted runs.

The CSV reader admits detail cells up to the ledger's byte length and
restores the caller's parser limit afterward. Large JSON cells therefore
retain their complete contents during timing audits and history validation;
no caller-side CSV limit override or truncation is needed.

Preserve every field of the finalizer's complete summary, including all
per-transition and per-pass results, timings and timing origins, terminal
and Task 2 classifications, retry reasons and intervals, recoveries,
stretch episodes/frames/durations, all counters, health gates and their
observed values, limits and applicability, memory boundaries and predicates,
resource/lifetime details, CPU/GPU/profiler evidence, build/deployment
provenance, and reporting gaps. Also retain every transition/pass comparison
delta, new/persistent/resolved health finding, reference identity, context
difference, tolerance policy and assessment limitation in the ledger.

Keep ordinary numeric timing rows. Use structured JSON detail cells for
records that cannot be represented faithfully as scalar metrics. Preserve
all fields, array entries, false, zero, null and empty containers without a
curated allowlist. Include a versioned coverage record mapping the summary
fields, passes and transition identities to their metric rows. The existing
`tuning_detail_*` rows and `tuning_detail_coverage_json` demonstrate this
layout. Raw receipt files and journals remain local; the ledger retains
their finalized results, identities and evidence references.

Before claiming completion, decode the ledger detail cells and reconstruct
the complete saved summary. Require field-for-field equality, exact
transition/pass coverage, and equality of the retained comparison details.
Audit all numeric timing cells as well, and retain the coverage-validation
receipt. Missing fields, truncated records, or available data replaced by
`n/a`, a generic "not derived" placeholder, an aggregate or a link mean
ledger reporting is incomplete even when runtime and evidence checks pass.

Genuinely unavailable measurements must retain their explicit reasons and
classification: not exposed, missing receipt, invalid measurement, not run,
or not applicable. Never invent a value to remove a gap. Preserve interrupted
segments and recovered failures. This rule forbids omissions of available
information; it does not turn unavailable telemetry into a measurement.

Prepare the complete new snapshot before writing. Include every metric
row for its selected runs, preserving retained cells exactly. For a detail
supplement to an existing run, create the next numbered snapshot, retain
the exact run identity, and describe the added evidence. Identify baseline
runs whose new detail rows were not populated; do not silently claim those
runs have passed the new coverage audit. Reuse the
comparison only after its content hashes match, and update the durable
report and iteration record with the coverage result.

## Required per-pass and per-transition detail

-   Exact run, compiled source, renderer base, main-VR base, Build ID, DLL
    hash/size and bridge backport; protocol/matrix, backend and dimensions.
-   Strict, presentation, cleanup and tail milliseconds; phase durations;
    absolute and percentage changes for every paired route in each pass.
-   Qualification-dispatch-to-strict frames, producer-request-to-applied
    relatch frames, and their timing origins. Keep these distinct. Show total
    stretch episodes, frames and milliseconds, recovery and any active tail.
-   Retry counts and reasons, request/epoch ownership, observed wait and
    stabilization intervals, and missing/overwritten retry evidence. A
    coalesced event cannot supply individual retry timestamps. Do not sum
    overlapping intervals or call the whole switch isolated retry overhead.
-   Device loss, OOM, terminal and lifecycle failures, fidelity mismatches,
    vendor/bounds fallback, phase violations, memory trim/retirement failures,
    and native backend evidence. Preserve all observed counters, including
    recovered events. Observations are not automatically unique frames.
-   Exact cumulative gate result, observed value, limit, applicability and
    reason. An inapplicable threshold remains visible without deciding health.
-   Per-pass totals, mean, median, p95 and maximum; worst affected routes and
    whether the direction repeats. Do not let a lower mean hide regressions.
-   Memory boundaries, deltas, pressure, resource lifetime/retirement and
    profiler evidence. Unresolved zero timer totals are unavailable timings;
    whole-frame GPU/FPS claims require fresh resolved samples and a matched
    scene/frame budget. Missing evidence is never zero cost or leak freedom.
-   Scene, timing, weather, adapter/driver, headset, fixture, modlist/cache,
    build/toolchain, pacing and measurement coverage differences. Separate
    worker/reporting delay from producer latency and health.

## Improvement and neutral claims

Always show observed deltas. Formal improvement or neutrality additionally
requires matching fixture evidence, repeat coverage, complete relevant
health evidence and an explicit versioned tolerance policy. Do not invent
a tolerance or claim significance from one process with two ordered passes.
The optional `--policy-path` supplies `id`, `absoluteToleranceMs`,
`relativeTolerancePercent`, and `requiredPasses` (at least two). Its identity
and values are embedded in the output. A route exceeds tolerance only when
it exceeds both the absolute and relative tolerances.

New adverse health findings prevent an improvement-or-neutral assessment
even when the average switch is faster. Without comparable evidence or a
declared tolerance, timing results are descriptive and the assessment is
inconclusive, unless concrete adverse health findings already demonstrate
that the standard is not met. Existing inapplicable stretch/native-target
gates are not evidence of a newly introduced regression.
