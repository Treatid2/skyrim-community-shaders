# NVIDIA tuning: PR73 269bded15, September 11

Displayed millisecond values are rounded to two decimal places. Full
precision is retained in the comparison ledger and raw evidence.

Run `nv-pr73-269bded1-mtwz6pez` completed both 33-transition NVIDIA passes. Execution is
**COMPLETE**, terminal render verdict **PASS**,
and Task 2 counts are **66 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 INCONCLUSIVE**.
Full-history health is **NO_COUNTED_FAILURES**: pass 1: NO_COUNTED_FAILURES, applicable standard MET; pass 2: NO_COUNTED_FAILURES, applicable standard MET.
Reporting is **COMPLETE**; reasons:
none.
The independently assessed improvement-or-neutral results are pr66: INCONCLUSIVE (retained_context_not_matched:scene, retained_context_not_matched:toolchain, matching_fixture_fingerprint_unavailable, explicit_versioned_tolerance_policy_missing); previous_pr73: INCONCLUSIVE (retained_context_not_matched:scene, matching_fixture_fingerprint_unavailable, explicit_versioned_tolerance_policy_missing).
These classifications are separate; completion and passing terminal checks
do not establish a performance improvement. The imposed stretch cutoff is a
diagnostic, not an applicable health gate. Separate
`csx-render-scale-pr-v1` release qualification remains unrun.

## Build and retained evidence

The producer is clean Release source `269bded159c66f4d8b1a45a836078dfa6cdf3241`,
Build ID `9b8b7f17af7ec7012eb194ad945b45756db313352ef6b2ec84d88a50bef9247b`. The exact enabled AIO is
`CSX_AIO-3.19-VR-mainVR-ef7c366d-PR73-269bded1-DevBench-no-cache`. Its physical DLL is 28,184,576
bytes with SHA-256 `086b2207bd4b615af5f7a1bb4f567bb0dba8e1c1ec5e5498cd440c623682380a`. The adjacent manifest,
producer receipt and preserved runtime identity agree; the complete
identity checks and their limitations remain in `dll-identity-verification.json`.

All evidence is retained under `C:\src\skyrim-community-shaders\artifacts\renderscale-tuning\nv-pr73-269bded1-mtwz6pez`. The local canonical CSV at
`docs/development/vr-render-scale-comparison-ledger.csv` reconstructs the
complete corrected summary and both comparisons exactly, including
528 unique candidate numeric timing
cells and 1056 checked numeric
cells per comparison. Every historical cell is preserved. The exact source
hashes and audit are in `complete-ledger-validation.json` and the report
writer receipt.

The GitHub ledger snapshot already occupies
104,132,789 bytes. An estimate using the initial report and
existing lossless subtree-reference encoding already required
109,580,999 bytes, exceeding its
104,857,600-byte blob limit. Every new field
remains in the complete local canonical ledger; the repository-published
[published ledger snapshot](vr-render-scale-ledger.md) does not
yet include this run. This report publishes the
current run and comparison tables without rewriting historical ledger cells.
The estimate and exact preservation checks remain in the evidence directory.

Finalization took 12.404 s. The PR66 and
prior-PR73 comparison wrappers took
3.148 and
3.137 s;
complete ledger preparation, reconstruction and update took
17.386 s. Exact per-stage timing receipts are retained.

## Owned drain and unchanged guard

Eighteen owned operations ran: rows 14-19, 25, 26 and 29 in both passes.
Each recorded one Pending event, one Backend retry, one commit and one
shared-cleanup completion marker. Readiness was observed one frame later,
45.33-56.79 ms after Pending. There are 22 provider-specific Ready
events because four operations observed both providers. No invalidation or
six-frame observation-budget expiry was exercised.

All 32 guard-arm events retain `minimumSettleFrames=6` and start in the
replacement's Applied frame. All 26 observed guard-satisfied events occur
at age six frames. The eight focused transitions retain Backend history,
`proofDrivenRelease=false` and `settleGuardRequired=true`; promotion follows
at age seven frames. The four earlier outliers become shorter, while their
previously short counterpart passes become longer. All eight focused
stretches remain four frames above PR66.

The FSR-only outlier audit changes from six pre-mutation plus seven
post-mutation stretch cycles to one plus six. The guard age is unchanged;
presentation-cycle counts and guard age are distinct measurements. Row 26
contains two stretch episodes totaling six frames in each candidate pass,
one before and five after mutation.

Intervals use saved QPC ticks and their producer frequency, correlated to
the immutable request and transition epoch. Ready means the last observed
provider-ready marker before commit, since one provider can become ready
before the operation's Pending event. These are observed intervals, not the
exact GPU completion instant. Commit-to-cleanup is elapsed time to a
completion marker, not isolated cleanup cost. Source generation, required
provider set and resource revision are not serialized in these event rows;
they must not be inferred from the target generation or poll counter.

## Reporter compatibility and lifecycle diagnostics

The original finalizer recognized only the older retry-event vocabulary.
New drain events made its cumulative capture validation report
`invalid_event`; that reporting defect did not erase the saved measurements
or change their terminal outcome. Corrected reporting is generated offline
from the same retained evidence. The prior report and comparisons remain
under `reporting-before-protocol-update`; no transitions were replayed to
repair this reporter gap.

The parser and protocol repair is committed in maintained
`skyrim-vr-automation` dev as
`c900f176eadcf6bc35cc4c8ffb64e564156fc367`. Parser, finalizer and comparison
Node tests, source/package protocol parity and skill validation passed.
`reporting-correction-provenance.json` pins the exact reporter commit,
source hashes and unchanged retained-input hashes. All 18 owned-operation
interval rows are published in the generated "Owned provider drain and
commit intervals" section below; the eight rows above are the focused
comparison requested for the earlier outliers.

The installed automation plugin `0.9.0+codex.20260911050803` still contains
the older parser. Until the corrected release is installed, subsequent
reporting must explicitly select the maintained source with
`--toolkit-root C:/src/skyrim-vr-automation` and finalize each new candidate
with `--finalize-candidate <request.json>`. Selecting a toolkit alone does
not regenerate an existing summary. The live worker only records evidence;
this explicit offline finalization avoids the gap without a plugin
reinstall. The installed parser itself remains unchanged.

An earlier startup handoff, `nv-pr73-269bded1-mtwywzvs`, was blocked before
measured mutation by the dead `cf1616728` crash-run endpoint lock. The exact
lock and diagnostics were preserved and its retirement was explicitly
authorized before this fresh run. This startup failure remains separate
from the completed 66-transition result.

The worker verified owned captures inactive, flushed all queued evidence
and released its endpoint lock. At `2026-09-11T13:24:30.2812610Z`, the worker
was absent and the game was still present. A later read-only observation at
`2026-09-11T13:29:18.0126197Z` found the expected game and MO2 processes
absent; the verifier performed no lifecycle action. No cause or orderly
shutdown is established for that later exit. The complete-run capture
cleanup evidence remains valid. Runtime modules were not freshly queried
after exit; RootBuilder's transient BuildData had also disappeared before
a persistent snapshot could be retained. These limits remain in the DLL
identity report.

## Complete generated run report

## renderscale-tuning-nvidia final report

-   Assay execution: **COMPLETE**
-   Transitions dispatched: **66/66**
-   Terminal render verdict: **PASS** (terminal condition only)
-   Lane qualification: **NOT_APPLICABLE**
-   Full-history switch health: **NO_COUNTED_FAILURES**
-   Change assessment: **INCONCLUSIVE**
-   Non-stable terminal notes: **0**
-   Task 2/evidence: **per transition** (66 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 INCONCLUSIVE)
-   Reporting completeness: **COMPLETE**
-   Deployment verification: **COMPLETE**
-   Memory confirmation: **inconclusive**
-   Presentation stretch: **33 selected, 33 recovered PASS, 0 unrecovered**

Task 2 is deliberately not aggregated. Reporting failure does not rewrite the render result, and a render pass does not hide missing per-transition evidence. Every raw JSON value is available in `evidence-values.csv`.

### Per-pass switch health and performance

Terminal PASS means the waiter reached its terminal condition. Full-history health, cumulative acceptance, evidence completeness, and change assessment remain separate. Recovered failures stay visible and do not relabel a completed test.

### Owned provider drain and commit intervals

Cells show frames / milliseconds from exact retained QPC endpoints. Ready means the last observed provider-ready event before the first commit; the required-provider set is not exposed. Commit-to-shared-cleanup is elapsed time to that marker, not isolated cleanup cost. Subsequent commit attempts, raw poll counts and missing identity fields remain in summary.json and CSV. The six-frame settling guard is reported separately.

### Transitions

Retry waits end at the first observed preparation-ready result. Ready-to-candidate includes stereo qualification and the settling guard; it is not isolated retry overhead. Overlapping viewport waits are not added. Unavailable results are n.d. and the affected reporting outcome is n/a. All retrieved values remain in raw evidence and evidence-values.csv; reporting provenance never aborts or replays measurements.

Full start/end memory evidence, CPU/GPU/resource counters, phase timings, retry details, native execution proofs, every gate and raw receipt hash are in comparison.json. comparison.csv contains every paired or missing transition with both original row payloads. Missing samples remain null/n/a. Current and baseline failures are preserved separately; a persistent gate failure is not automatically a newly introduced regression. The fixed stretch-frame cutoff is diagnostic only because settling imposes stretch. Compare its actual frames and duration, together with time to applied relatch and strict completion. Request-to-applied frames begin at the producer request, whereas strict frames/ms begin at qualification dispatch; these intervals must not be conflated.

-   Headset refresh, driver version, power state and full modlist/cache equality require retained proof.
-   One process and ordered repeats do not establish causal or statistically significant gains.
-   Missing profiler samples are unavailable time evidence, never zero cost.

### Context, memory, CPU/GPU and evidence

Full start/end memory evidence, CPU/GPU/resource counters, phase timings, retry details, native execution proofs, every gate and raw receipt hash are in comparison.json. comparison.csv contains every paired or missing transition with both original row payloads. Missing samples remain null/n/a. Current and baseline failures are preserved separately; a persistent gate failure is not automatically a newly introduced regression. The fixed stretch-frame cutoff is diagnostic only because settling imposes stretch. Compare its actual frames and duration, together with time to applied relatch and strict completion. Request-to-applied frames begin at the producer request, whereas strict frames/ms begin at qualification dispatch; these intervals must not be conflated.

-   Headset refresh, driver version, power state and full modlist/cache equality require retained proof.
-   One process and ordered repeats do not establish causal or statistically significant gains.
-   Missing profiler samples are unavailable time evidence, never zero cost.
