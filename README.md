# Community Shaders Expanded (CSX) – Unofficial Fork

SKSE core plugin for community-driven advanced graphics modifications.

Community Shaders Expanded (CSX) restores (and extends) Particle Lights functionality removed after Community Shaders 1.3.6. It also enables Screen Space Shadows (SSS) in VR again while remaining compatible with SE and AE. While SSS is not perfect in VR, especially when using upscaling, the visual benefits outweigh the potential bugs for me. Using SSS version 1.2.1 is recommended.

This fork inherits the original GPL-3.0-or-later license with the Modding Exception and Linking Exception (see below).

## Installing a CSX release

Download the single `CSX_AIO-*.7z` asset from the
[CSX releases page](https://github.com/ParticleTroned/skyrim-community-shaders/releases).
All shipped features are bundled, including Adaptive Balance, Performance
Tuning, Wetterness, Unified Water, Hair Specular and the terrain features.
The FOMOD offers VR, SE/AE, or no prebuilt shader cache; each runtime cache
includes both standard and Horizon Fix Water variants. Optional integrations
still require their companion plugins. GitHub's source archives are for
development, not installation.

## Requirements

-   Any terminal of your choice (e.g., PowerShell)
-   [Visual Studio Community 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
    -   Desktop development with C++
    -   CMake Tools for Windows
    -   HLSL Tools
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    -   Edit the `PATH` environment variable and add the Git.exe install path as a new value

## Optional Requirements

```
CMake & Vcpkg comes with Visual Studio in Developer Command Prompts already.
Install them manually only if you want them in everywhere.
```

-   [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
    -   No need to install manually if you have Visual Studio CMake Tools installed
    -   CMake 4.2+ is **required** now
    -   Edit the `PATH` environment variable and add the cmake.exe install path as a new value
    -   Instructions for finding and editing the `PATH` environment variable can be found [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html)
-   [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
    -   Install vcpkg using the directions in vcpkg's [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows)
    -   After install, add a new environment variable named `VCPKG_ROOT` with the value as the path to the folder containing vcpkg
    -   Make sure your local vcpkg repo matches the commit id specified in `builtin-baseline` in `vcpkg.json` otherwise you might get another version of a non pinned vcpkg dependency causing undefined behaviour

## User Requirements

-   [Address Library for SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)
    -   Needed for SSE/AE
-   [VR Address Library for SKSEVR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58101)
    -   Version 0.269.0 or later is required for VR, including forced-weather sky model cleanup.

## Build Instructions

### Clone the Repository with submodules

To clone the repository with all submodules, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParticleTroned/skyrim-community-shaders.git --recursive
cd skyrim-community-shaders
```

### Visual Studio build

To build the project, just open `./skyrim-community-shaders` with Visual Studio's "Open Folder" feature. (Ensure you have `CMake Tools for Windows` selected when installing VS)

Follow the prompts to `Configure` and `Build` the project.
It should generate the AIO package in the `./build/ALL/aio` folder by default.

#### Zip package & Optional targets

If you change the `Solution Explorer` into `CMake Targets View`, you can find optional targets to create zip packages for each feature.
Right click on the target and select `Build` to create the zip package in `./dist/`.

### Advanced build with CMake in command line

Open the "Developer PowerShell for VS 2026" or the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" (these set up the Visual Studio toolchain for you).

Then from the repository root run:

```pwsh
# Generate the build files (uses the ALL preset)
cmake --preset ALL

# Build using the preset
cmake --build --preset ALL

# Refresh the isolated AIO staging package in ./build/ALL/aio
cmake --install ./build/ALL --config Release

# Copy the staged package into the mod folder without deleting that folder
cmake -E copy_directory ./build/ALL/aio $MOD_FOLDER
```

# Notes

-   If you prefer to run the VC environment manually, launch Developer PowerShell or the x64 Native Tools prompt instead of calling vcvarsall.bat directly from PowerShell.
-   `BuildRelease.bat ALL` performs the configure and package build. Use an auto-deployment preset when the output should be copied directly to a mod folder.

#### Build a zip package

You can build zip packages for optional cmake targets.
Developer packaging supports `AIO_ZIP_PACKAGE`, `Package-AIO-Manual`,
`Package-Core`, and `Package-<Feature>`. Core-only and individual feature
packages are internal build outputs; public CSX releases use the
[complete AIO with its cache FOMOD](docs/development/csx-release-distribution.md):

```pwsh
# Create a AIO package in ./dist/
# Automated AIO zip (requires AIO_ZIP_TO_DIST=ON)
cmake --build ./build/ALL --config Release --target AIO_ZIP_PACKAGE

# Manual AIO package (install + tar)
cmake --build ./build/ALL --config Release --target Package-AIO-Manual

# Create a CSX core package in ./dist/
cmake --build ./build/ALL --config Release --target Package-Core

# Create a feature package in ./dist/ (example: GrassLighting)
cmake --build ./build/ALL --config Release --target Package-GrassLighting
```

For more details about packaging targets, options, and the difference between automated and manual packaging, see the "Manual packaging targets (detailed)" section in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

#### CMAKE Options (optional)

If you want an example CMakeUserPreset to start off with you can copy the `CMakeUserPresets.json.template` -> `CMakeUserPresets.json`

#### AUTO_PLUGIN_DEPLOYMENT

-   This option is default `"OFF"`
-   Make sure `"AUTO_PLUGIN_DEPLOYMENT"` is set to `"ON"` in `CMakeUserPresets.json`
-   Change the `"CommunityShadersOutputDir"` value to match your desired outputs, if you want multiple folders you can separate them by `;` is shown in the template example

#### TRACY_SUPPORT

-   This option is default `"OFF"`
-   Enables Tracy instrumentation in the DLL. Reconfigure after changing it.
-   With this option off, the DLL uses only Tracy's disabled macros and does not link the Tracy client. DevBench capture controls are independently gated by `DEVBENCH_BRIDGE`.
-   The client is pinned to Tracy `0.14.2-a8db9bd8`, protocol **83**. Capture and viewer tools must use the same protocol.
-   The `ALL-TRACY` configure preset also selects the `tracy-tools` manifest feature, building the CLI tools and viewer from the same pinned source. Custom presets can select `VCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=tracy-tools` alongside `TRACY_SUPPORT=ON`.

To build the matched profiling configuration:

```powershell
pwsh ./tools/cmake.ps1 --preset ALL-TRACY
pwsh ./tools/cmake.ps1 --build build/ALL-TRACY --config Release --target CommunityShaders
```

With the default install layout, use `tracy-capture.exe`, `tracy-csvexport.exe`
and `tracy-profiler.exe` under
`build/ALL-TRACY/vcpkg_installed/x64-windows-static-md/tools/tracy`.
The tools build in Release; production presets keep them optional and keep
Tracy instrumentation disabled. Existing binaries remain at their original
protocol until rebuilt, so retain their matched tools for older captures.

When using custom preset you can call BuildRelease.bat with an parameter to specify which preset to configure eg:
`.\BuildRelease.bat ALL-WITH-AUTO-DEPLOYMENT`

When switching between different presets you might need to remove the build folder

### Build with Docker

For those who prefer to not install Visual Studio or other build dependencies on their machine, this encapsulates it. This uses Windows Containers, so no WSL for now.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) first if not already there.
2. In a shell of your choice run to switch to Windows containers and create the build container:

```pwsh
& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchWindowsEngine; `
docker build -t skyrim-community-shaders .
```

3. Then run the build:

```pwsh
docker run -it --rm -v .:C:/skyrim-community-shaders skyrim-community-shaders:latest
```

4. Retrieve the generated build files from the `build/aio` folder.
5. In subsequent builds only run the build step (3.)

#### Troubleshooting Build with Docker

If you run into `Access violation` build errors during step 3, you can try adding [`--isolation=process`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container):

```pwsh
docker run -it --rm --isolation=process -v .:C:/skyrim-community-shaders skyrim-community-shaders:latest
```

## Debugging

### Launching MO2-SKSE-Skyrim from commandline

1. Open Steam
2. Close ModOrganizer GUI
3. Add `ModOrganizer.exe` (MO2 Folder) to your PATH, or use the path of it
4. Run the commands:

```pwsh
# Change Working Directory
cd "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition"
# Launch SKSE with MO2
ModOrganizer.exe --log run "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\skse64_loader.exe"
```

### Capture with RenderDoc

-   [x] **Capture Child Process**

## License

### Default

[GPL-3.0-or-later](COPYING) WITH [Modding Exception AND GPL-3.0 Linking Exception (with Corresponding Source)](EXCEPTIONS.md).  
Specifically, the “Modded Code” includes:

-   The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (and its variants)
-   Third-party components used to enable optional upscaling / frame generation features, which are distributed under their own licenses, for example:
    -   NVIDIA DLSS (proprietary SDK/runtime; e.g., nvngx_dlss.dll) — https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/dlss/get-started
    -   AMD FidelityFX FSR 3 (MIT-licensed, via GPUOpen) — https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-super-resolution-3/

The Modding Libraries include:

-   [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/)
-   Commonlib (and variants).

#### NVIDIA DLSS / Streamline

NVIDIA components retain their own licenses; this project's GPL and linking
exceptions do not change NVIDIA's terms or grant additional rights to its SDKs.
Streamline's source license and the separate DLSS/NGX and Reflex SDK terms are
included with the packaged runtime.

The build downloads the production x64 DLLs directly from
[NVIDIA's Streamline 2.14.1 SDK release](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline/releases/tag/v2.14.1)
and verifies the archive's pinned SHA-256 in
[Streamline-Runtime.cmake](cmake/Streamline-Runtime.cmake). These runtime DLLs are
not checked into this repository. The same archive supplies all five license
and notice files, copied without modification beside the DLLs under
`Shaders/Upscaling/Streamline/` in both Core and AIO packages:

-   `license.txt` — Streamline source license.
-   `nvngx_dlss.license.txt` — NVIDIA RTX SDK terms for DLSS/NGX.
-   `reflex.license.txt` — NVIDIA Reflex SDK terms.
-   `3rd-party-licenses.md` — Streamline third-party notices.
-   `NVIDIA Nsight Graphics SDK License (Apache 2.0).txt` — Nsight Graphics SDK terms.

The `StreamlineRuntime` CMake install component includes these notices with its
DLLs. Source builds obtain the Streamline source license and third-party notices
through the pinned [Streamline submodule](extern/Streamline-DX12).

The public 2.14.1 SDK archive does not contain `sl.dlss_nr.dll`,
`nvngx_dlssnr.dll`, or their implementation sources. This update does not package
DLSS Neural Rendering or add support for it.

### SKSE Plugin API

[LGPL-3.0-or-later](COPYING.LESSER): `include/VRAPI/CSinterface001.h` and
`src/VRAPI/CSinterface001.cpp` only (see [API.md](API.md)). Everything else
under `VRAPI/` remains [Default](#default).

### Shaders

See LICENSE within each directory; if none, it's [Default](#default)
